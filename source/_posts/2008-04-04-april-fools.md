The Internet community had some great pranks this April Fools. I was reminded that the world is incredibly well-connected when I noticed a few foreign sites were down. Being 10pm here, I thought nothing of it. Minutes later my friend reminded me that it was April Fools some places...

On the home front, Google had a few funny pranks, namely Virgle and Gmail custom time. Actually, I think these are both good ideas. If only we had a few days a year to pitch ideas and roll them back when they're not well received... Youtube was also hilarious by Rick Rolling us all. No guarantees, but for now I say "I'm never gonna let you go!"

If I put a link <a title="clicky" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBGIQ7ZuuiU">here</a>, will you click it? Good! Good.
