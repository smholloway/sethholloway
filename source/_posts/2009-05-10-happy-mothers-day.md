Happy Mother's Day to all the wonderful mothers in the world! You achieved your biological imperative and kept humanity as a whole alive. Thanks for that!

A special thanks to my amazing mother who deserves sainthood for dealing with three, ahem, precocious kids. And to my mother-in-law who was in a similar situation, except my mother-in-law had three perfect children--especially her daughter :)

I hope everyone has a great day and properly appreciates the one who gave them life!
