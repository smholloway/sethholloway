In preparation for an exciting trip to Thailand, I got vaccinated against all (okay, a small subset of) the baddies that seek to share my body. As an American in good living conditions, I have never worried about these ailments, but they are a reality in other countries so I thought it best to be protected. Last Tuesday I was given three shots:

	 * <a title="Wikipedia: Hepatitis A" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_A" target="_blank">Hepatitis A</a> and <a title="Wikipedia: Hepatitis B" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_B" target="_blank">B</a>
	 * <a title="Wikipedia: Tetanus" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetanus" target="_blank">Tetanus</a>/<a title="Wikipedia: Diphtheria" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diphtheria" target="_blank">Diphtheria</a>
	 * <a title="Wikipedia: Influenza" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza" target="_blank">Influenza</a>

Tuesday morning my arms were sore and I had the sniffles. By afternoon I needed a nap. Wednesday, I was uncontrollably tired--I slept about 12 hours and lazed around the rest of the day. This felt very much like a weak version of the flu, so I assume the effects were caused by the flu shot.

My fourth vaccine was an oral <a title="Wikipedia: Typhoid" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typhoid" target="_blank">Typhoid</a> vaccine, Vivotif, which consists of four pills--one every other day. Andrea had taken Vivotif in preparation for her trip, so I had seen one set of potential side effects. To avoid discomfort, I took my pills shortly before bed. My first Vivotif pill was simple; if there were any side effects, I could not differentiate them from those suffered from my three shots. The second pill was okay; I had some dull stomach pains, but nothing awful. After a few days, I saw that the effect seemed to be cumulative. Saturday was unpleasant and Sunday was rough. Monday, my stomach hurt all day and I finished the dose with a feeling of being poisoned, except my body would not, or could not, evacuate the offender. Tuesday I slept almost 12 hours as I had right after receiving the other vaccines; with lingering stomach pain, I ate with care. Today, I'm feeling better and hope to be back to 100% by tomorrow.

The moral of the story: vaccines for travel to Thailand make me feel blah, but they're better than the full-on illnesses!

Should I have avoided the vaccines? Have you had similar experiences?
