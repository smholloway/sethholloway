Yesterday my grandmother, Viola Holloway, passed away after 89 fruitful years. While this is incredibly painful for me, her passing is not all sad; given her condition this semester, I can say she's in a  better place now.

Viola was an awesome grandma, and I'm going to miss her tremendously. She always had treats and encouraging words for me! I will cherish the memories and try to be as loving and supportive of my progeny as she was of hers.

Exercise. Be happy. Live simply. Viola had it right.
