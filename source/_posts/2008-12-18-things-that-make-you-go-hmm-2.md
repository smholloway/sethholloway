The cost of owning a car is made up of insurance plus fuel plus maintenance plus registration and inspection. The fixed costs alone make a car cost over $1 a day!

Hmm...

This is something that I realized after we became a two-car household. Public transportation costs about the same if you buy single fares. However, some organizations work out deals for their constituents to ride free (UT for example). Also, anyone can buy a bus pass that reduces the costs significantly.

Paying over $1 a day for something I don't use is silly, but I'm not ready to give up the other car.
