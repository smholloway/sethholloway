Because college <a title="seth holloway dot com college football is big business" href="http://sethholloway.com/blog/?p=331" target="_blank">football is big business</a>, it is big news that UT Defensive Coordinator <a title="wikipedia Will Muschamp" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Muschamp" target="_blank">Will Muschamp</a> is next in line for <a title="Daily Texan" href="http://www.dailytexanonline.com/football_muschamp_seals_future_in_texas" target="_blank">head coach at UT</a>. This is good news because it shows that Texas football will promote high achieving individuals, and Muschamp is a talented spitfire.

I predict that <a title="Mack Brown" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mack_Brown" target="_blank">Mack Brown</a> and <a title="Colt McCoy" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colt_McCoy" target="_blank">Colt McCoy</a> will stick around until next year when UT wins the national championship and Colt wins <a title="Heisman Trophy" href="http://www.heisman.com/" target="_blank">Heisman</a>. Mack will then step down and Muschamp will take over the championship team.
