I had a great weekend that was fun and productive (which is notable because it's normally one or the other)! Today, I had a few things to post about, but I am absolutely blown away by this drumguitar:

I'm impressed with not only his skills, but the fact that he took time to learn a useless instrument. Hell, the fact that he would make that instrument impresses me that 1) he could make it 2) it would work and 3) that he would make a useless instrument.<a title="http://www.todaysbigthing.com/2008/11/17" href="http://www.todaysbigthing.com/2008/11/17" target="_blank"></a>
