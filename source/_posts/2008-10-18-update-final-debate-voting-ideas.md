Earlier this week I mentioned a couple ideas to <a title="Seth Holloway dot com" href="http://sethholloway.com/blog/?p=205" target="_blank">freshen voting</a>. Sean mentioned the <a title="wikipedia condorcet" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet_method" target="_blank">Condorcet method</a> which is really cool (thanks!). The meat of the idea is to rank each candidate in terms of preference then determine the winner with a neat algorithm. I like that "... the Condorcet method yields the "best compromise" candidate, the one that the largest majority will find to be least disagreeable..."

Imagine all the heads exploding when <a title="wikipedia john q public" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Q._Public" target="_blank">Joes Sixpack</a> had to try and maximize their personal interests. With three candidates on the ballot, Republicans and Democrats would cancel one another out and a third party would rise as the 'least disagreeable' candidate. One can dream...
