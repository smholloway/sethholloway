In talking to some of my friends I realized that not everyone has heard the news: Rock Band 2 is out, and it is <a title="ARS Technica review" href="http://arstechnica.com/reviews/games/rock-band-2-review.ars/1" target="_blank">awesome</a>! There are at least <a title="improvements by rock band 2" href="http://blog.wired.com/games/2008/09/gamelife-the--3.html" target="_blank">five improvements</a> over Rock Band which was a great game. I've played a handful of songs and I highly recommend the game if you already have the instruments (from Rock Band).
