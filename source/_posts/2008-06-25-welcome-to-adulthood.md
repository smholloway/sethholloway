<a title="andrea mire holloway" href="http://andrea.sethholloway.com" target="_blank">Andrea</a> is now officially <a title="wife of mine!" href="http://relations.of.sethholloway.com" target="_blank">Mrs. Seth Holloway</a>. The wedding was a beautiful, small affair in the hills overlooking Lake Travis. I hope all the guests had a good time--I know I did! My apologies if I did not get a chance to talk to you, or if you were not invited (space was limited).

We just got back from a short honeymoon on Canyon Lake. Thanks to Justin at the <a title="the lakehouse bed and breakfast on canyon lake" href="http://www.thelakehousebb.com" target="_blank">Lakehouse Bed and Breakfast</a> for a wonderful stay. I highly recommend this destination if you want to get away from it all without traveling for hours or breaking the bank.

We're now trying to organize everything, merge old and new items, and establish some semblance of normalcy.
