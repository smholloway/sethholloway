I'm interested to see what other people think the answer is. Don't overthink it. What's the first (relevant) thing that pops into your head for this question: "What are the 2nd-to-last 4 digits of the sequence: 123456789?"

No peeking at other people's work first!

Edit: Put a question mark at the end of the supposed question.
