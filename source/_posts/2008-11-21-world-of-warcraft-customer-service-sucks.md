I play World of Warcraft (WoW). I have played off and on since the game was released four years ago. Now the folks at Blizzard have released a second expansion, Wrath of the Lich King (WotLK). Prior to WotLK's release, Blizzard started a promotion called Recruit a Friend (RaF). RaF allows a veter to recruit a friend and play together with a number of benefits. The key benefit, in my opinion, was the ability for the friend to grant levels to the veteran essentially keeping both characters at the same level so they can continue to adventure together.

The deal hit after I had quit, so a friend of mine referred me and we played. You can see that I created the account on August 5th.

On November 3, the last night of our account link (which ran through 11-4-08 as seen below), I had several levels to grant to Jason.

We met up and found that we were no longer linked. We both opened a help request in game. After four hours a game master (GM) showed up to Jason and was pretty professional. I got a sassy son of a bitch who closed the help ticket while I was talking to him. Eventually Jason was told to contact billing because there was nothing more the GM could do for him.

The next day Jason called billing and found out that our accounts were linked for exactly 90 days and the time displayed on the website was only an estimate.

To add insult to injury, the ultimate resolution was three free days of play-time. No level grants, no honoring the contract, just three days play-time and a lot of disingenuous apologetic hogwash. Bah!
