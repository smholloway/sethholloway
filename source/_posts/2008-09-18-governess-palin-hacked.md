Alaska Governess Palin had <a title="ZDNet coverage" href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/security/?p=1919" target="_blank">her Yahoo mail account hacked</a> recently. The hacker released a screenshot of one email:

<a href="http://wikileaks.org/leak/sarah-palin-hack-2008/01.jpg"><img src="http://wikileaks.org/leak/sarah-palin-hack-2008/01.jpg" alt="Palin leaked email" /></a>

It is out of context, but Palin seems loyal, friendly, and helpful. I'm actually impressed.

I find the attack amusing, but I fear that going after high profile politicians is not the way to achieve anything. The hacker has likely hastened the end of net neutrality and Internet anonymity as politicians clamor for control. For hackers, of course, this is no worry because they're not going to be traced anyway, but it's bad for the rest of us.
