Last night we went to <a title="Homepage currently down :-\" href="http://www.midorisushiaustin.com/" target="_blank">Midori</a>, a sushi/Asian food restaurant in NW Austin. <a title="Only website you need...EVAR" href="http://www.laneholloway.com" target="_blank">Lane</a> went here for his birthday meal and liked it. I was really excited after I read the <a title="Yelp: Midori" href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/midori-sushi-austin" target="_blank">overwhelmingly positive reviews</a>. Even the local Fox affiliates foodie, <a title="Rob Balon on Midori" href="http://www.diningoutwithrobbalon.com/review/midori/" target="_blank">Rob Balon, loved it</a>!

After eating there I must say that I was impressed. Everything was absolutely delicious! The miso was a treat; the house salad was fresh and satisfying; the teriyaki was superb; and the sushi was fantastic. I recommend the Boca Raton roll which is similar to Maru's J-Bomb, but way less spicy.

Beyond great food the place has ambience. The interior is very clean; the restaurant is decorated with Japanese-looking pieces. Waitresses wear traditional Japanese garb and the sushi chefs welcome you with a Japanese "hello"--I've been watching anime long enough to know some Japanese! Fun.

I will be returning to Midori!
