I'd like to wish my lovely bride, <a title="Andrea's blank website" href="http://andrea.sethholloway.com/" target="_blank">Andrea Mire Holloway</a>, a happy birthday! It's not everyday you have a birthday after all!

For the rest of you, happy Martin Luther King Jr. Day. If you're still not affected by my glee, happy Monday :)
