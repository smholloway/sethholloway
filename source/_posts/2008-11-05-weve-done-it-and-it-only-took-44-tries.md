A young black man is the next president of the United States of America. Congratulations to Obama on the win! McCain's concession speech showed that McCain is a decent person after all.

Talking to a few people on Election Day '08, they said they prefered McCain when he wasn't running for office. I feel the same way; McCain is an American hero, but he screwed the pooch on this campaign. God help us to not get Palin in 2012!
