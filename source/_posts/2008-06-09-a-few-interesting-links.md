A  number of groups are providing free kits for a variety of hacking tasks. It amuses me that anyone would trust malware as evidenced <a title="no honor among thieves" href="http://news.netcraft.com/archives/2008/01/22/mrbrain_stealing_phish_from_fraudsters.html" target="_blank">here</a>.

Andrea's been looking for a program to edit her digital photos. Photoscape <a title="photoscape described on lifehacker" href="http://lifehacker.com/395132/photoscape-fixes-and-enhances-your-pictures" target="_blank">looks like</a> a promising option. We'll have to try it out.
