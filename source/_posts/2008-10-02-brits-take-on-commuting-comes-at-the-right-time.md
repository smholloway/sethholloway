The BBC has a nice piece on <a title="BBC article on how to enjoy the commute" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/7635486.stm" target="_blank">how to enjoy your commute</a> with tips from <a title="how we drive.com" href="http://www.howwedrive.com/" target="_blank">Tom</a> <a title="tom vanderbilt dot com" href="http://www.tomvanderbilt.com/" target="_blank">Vanderbilt</a>, author of <a title="Amazon of Book" href="http://www.amazon.com/Traffic-Drive-What-Says-About/dp/0307264785/" target="_blank">Traffic: Why We Drive the Way We Do (and What It Says About Us)</a>. The article is pretty interesting; it applies to US driving for the most part; some tips are obvious. I would not think much of it, but this morning a furious motorist yelled at four cyclists who went through a stop sign at the same time (me and one other stopped and waited our turn; the other two rode through milliseconds behind me). Right after I cleared the intersection I heard shouting. Whenever I looked back I saw the SUV stopped in the intersection, driver's-side window down, with a guy screaming. Five seconds later, it was done.

The outburst is upsetting because it is the first car-to-bike roadrage that I've witnessed. Beyond being gratuitous, I'm struck that someone was already so upset by 7:45am! Hopefully the irate motorist will read the tips and chill out.

Beyond reducing the roadrage, my suggestion is to enjoy the crisp morning air on a lovely bike ride. Get some exercise while you enjoy nature--it's nice.
