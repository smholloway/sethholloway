The World Wide Web is full of great deals! You can get all kinds of good stuff, if you know where to look. One popular scheme is to get a set amount of an item then sell it until it's gone; rinse and repeat. For example, <a href="http://www.woot.com" target="_blank">Woot</a> always runs one big deal. Woot also has subdomains for <a href="http://wine.woot.com" target="_blank">wine</a> and <a href="http://shirt.woot.com" target="_blank">shirts</a>. A similar idea, but for performance gear, <a href="http://www.steepandcheap.com/" target="_blank">Steep and Cheap</a> is great. I'm watching for a small, waterproof messenger bag for under $40 (they're normally over $100). <a title="Slick Deals dot Net" href="http://slickdeals.net/" target="_blank">SlickDeals</a> aggregates different deals like a top-of-the-line Dell for $500! One last discount site I like is <a href="http://www.overstock.com" target="_blank">Overstock.com</a>. I got my simple wedding ring on Overstock for a very good price :)

But alas, I'm a poor graduate student and these sites make me want to consumer whore so I must abstain.

If you know of other good deal sites, I'm interested in hearing about them!
