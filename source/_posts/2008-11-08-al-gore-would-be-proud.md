Wired published an article entitled the <a title="Wired: Latest Extinction is the Greatest" href="http://blog.wired.com/wiredscience/2008/09/latest-extincti.html" target="_blank">Latest Extinction is the Greatest</a>. From the story we learn that the current die-off is the highest ever seen in history. The article has the possibility to be more sensational, but the author does not go the extra mile. No cries of "the end is nigh" although the feeling is there. As with the recent coverage of banks closing, there is no information about how to stop the crisis, only that we should all run and hide. I'll see you guys on Mars--I'll be the one in the tinfoil hat!

Obama inherits a range of problems; I'm curious to see where protecting species falls.
