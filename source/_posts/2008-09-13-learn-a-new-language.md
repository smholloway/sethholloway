Andrea and I love language and culture, although she actually has the degrees to back it up. We love to travel and see how other people live. I ask people about their native tongues; by doing so I've learned how to say "hello" in about 15 languages. In the future I'd like to beef up my vocabulary more. To do so, I've found a couple sites with free language education: <a title="BBC Languages" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/languages/" target="_blank">BBC Languages</a> and <a title="MIT Open Courses on Language" href="http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/web/courses/courses/index.htm#ForeignLanguagesandLiteratures" target="_blank">MIT Open Courses</a>.

Unfortunately, I have not made time to learn a new language yet, but I'd love to hear how other people feel about the sites :)

If you're struggling with English and you live in the Austin area, you should talk to <a title="Andrea Mire Linkedin" href="http://www.linkedin.com/profile?viewProfile=&amp;key=29993716" target="_blank">Andrea Holloway</a> about accent modification! She has helped several people to improve their pronounciation and is currently working with <a title="Alison McGregor PhD Linkedin" href="http://www.linkedin.com/profile?viewProfile=&amp;key=7298067" target="_blank">Alison McGregor PhD</a>, an <a title="UT ESL Faculty" href="http://www.utexas.edu/student/esl/faculty/" target="_blank">expert </a>on accent modification.
