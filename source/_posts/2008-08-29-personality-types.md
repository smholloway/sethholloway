Well, it took me 26 years and a number of conversations, but I finally understand that there are different personalities. There are a number of personality classifications, but the Briggs/Meyers/Jung are the ones I've started looking into. You can take a short survey/quiz <a title="E/I N/S T/F J/P classification" href="http://www.personalitytype.com/quiz.html" target="_blank">here</a>.

Descriptions (<a title="similarminds.com description of ENTP" href="http://similarminds.com/jung/entp.html" target="_blank">here</a>, <a title="personalitypage.com description of ENTP" href="http://www.personalitypage.com/ENTP.html" target="_blank">here</a>, and <a title="personalitytype.com description of ENTP" href="http://www.personalitytype.com/types/entp.html" target="_blank">here</a>) vary slightly, but ENTP seems to fit me; what are you?

After you find your four-letter description, visit the description sites (<a title="similarminds.com description of ENTP" href="http://similarminds.com/jung/entp.html" target="_blank">here</a>, <a title="personalitypage.com description of ENTP" href="http://www.personalitypage.com/ENTP.html" target="_blank">here</a>, and <a title="personalitytype.com description of ENTP" href="http://www.personalitytype.com/types/entp.html" target="_blank">here</a>) then change "entp" to your four-letter description in the address bar. For example, if you're INFJ, go tohttp://www.personalitypage.com/ENTP.html then replace ENTP with INFJ (making the address http://www.personalitypage.com/INFJ.html) and hit Enter.
