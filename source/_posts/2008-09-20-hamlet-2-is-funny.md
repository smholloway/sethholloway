We saw Hamlet 2 last night. It was funnier than expected, and I am now a fan of Steve Coogan! I'd give Hamlet 2 a 7/10. The rest of the world feels about the same:

	 * <a title="IMDB Hamlet 2" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1104733/" target="_blank">IMDB</a> gave it a 6.4/10
	 * <a title="Rotten Tomatoes Hamlet 2" href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/hamlet_2/" target="_blank">Rotten Tomatoes</a> gave is a 63/100
	 * <a title="Metacritic Hamlet 2" href="http://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/hamlet2?q=hamlet%202" target="_blank">Metacritic</a> critics gave it a 5.4/10 while users gave is a 6.5/10

If you want to laugh, go watch Hamlet 2--and keep an open mind :)
