The election is a month away, and today is the last day you can register to vote! Do it!

While the politicians bicker and blame one another about <a title="Analysis of what really happened" href="http://techdirt.com/articles/20080929/0426042403.shtml" target="_blank">what happened</a>, the rest of us are left holding the bag. If you're like me, you're ready for someone new. Can't wait to vote? You may be eligible for early voting! <a title="Early Voting Information Center" href="http://earlyvoting.net/states/abslaws.php" target="_blank">The Early Voting Inforation Center</a> is a great resource for determining if you can vote early.

Here's the detailed blurb about Texas:
<br>
<table id="abs_tab" border="0" width="450">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Yes. Early voting. No excuse required. Early voting in person starts 17 days before each election unless the first day falls on the weekend, then early voting begins on the following Monday and ends 4 days before each election. <span class="source"><a title="Tex. Elec. Code 81.001" href="http://tlo2.tlc.state.tx.us/statutes/docs/EL/content/htm/el.007.00.000081.00.htm#81.001.00">Tex. Elec. Code 81.001</a></span></td>
</tr>
