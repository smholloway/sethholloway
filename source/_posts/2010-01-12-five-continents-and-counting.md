I'm back from Thailand! After 18 days visiting Andrea in the "<a title="Wikipedia: Thailand" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand" target="_blank">Land of the free</a>" (Thailand was free from imperialism), I return to my wonderful Austin life. My first immersion in Asia was fantastic; I saw and experienced a ton! I've now spent at least a few days on five continents, and every culture has such new and interesting traditions. I'm not sure I'd want to live in Thailand, but the country is worth a visit.

Over on her <a title="Andrea Holloway" href="http://andreaholloway.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">blog</a>, Andrea posted <a title="Andrea Holloway: Lucky Me!" href="http://andreaholloway.wordpress.com/2010/01/11/lucky-me/" target="_blank">her side of the story as well as some pictures</a>. I'll update this post or write some follow-ups to provide more information.
