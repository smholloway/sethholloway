This morning my cat jumped on the bed, walked up to me, plopped down on my head, and started purring. This morning ritual can be annoying, but I appreciate how open with his feelings the cat is. When he likes something, he purrs; when he doesn't, he runs off. With the holiday season upon us, I think this is a great way to live: show whenever you like something, and if you're unhappy then walk away.

Happy holidays everyone! Be like a cat and enjoy life your way :)
