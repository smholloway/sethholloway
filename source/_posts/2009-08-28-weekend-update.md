School has officially resumed! I am busy writing and rewriting my PhD research now as I prepare to propose in October. I wanted to make a quick post in the midst of it all.

First, thanks to everyone who participated in the smart home survey! We received tremendous support and high quality responses. Beyond that, I'll be continuing my support of <a title="Students in Software Engineering @ UT" href="http://www.edge.utexas.edu/sse/" target="_blank">Students in Software Engineering</a>, now led by the very awesome Justin Enderle.

As school starts back up, I return to listening to music almost constantly while on campus. <a title="Pandora Online Radio" href="http://www.pandora.com">Pandora</a> has imposed limits on playtime, but luckily other services are taking its place. I'm relatively happy with <a title="Slacker Public Radio" href="http://www.slacker.com/" target="_blank">Slacker Personal Radio</a> after my Pandora playtime is up for the month. <a title="Last FM Internet Radio" href="http://www.last.fm" target="_blank">Last.fm</a> is another nice alternative, and I've heard recommendations for <a title="I Heart Radio" href="http://www.iheartradio.com/national_radio_tuner/main.html" target="_blank">I Heart Radio</a> and <a title="Yahoo! Music" href="http://new.music.yahoo.com/" target="_blank">Yahoo! Music</a>, though the lack of customization deters me. Have you found a better service?

I'd like to share a great article on <a title="The Atlantic: Health Care" href="http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200909/health-care/" target="_blank">America's incorrect direction for health care reform</a>. Here's an excerpt:
<blockquote>Incentives that emphasize health <em>care</em> over any other aspect of health and well-being. That emphasize treatment over prevention. That disguise true costs. That favor complexity, and discourage transparent competition based on price or quality. That result in a generational pyramid scheme rather than sustainable financing.</blockquote>
I have not had time to write a decent post about this, so I'll just link an interesting read about <a title="Death Row Lunacy" href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2009-08-18/scalias-death-row-lunacy/" target="_blank">Supreme Court Justice Scalia and his blind allegiance to "the law."</a> And a tasty nugget:
<blockquote>“This court,” Scalia pointed out, “has never held that the Constitution forbids the execution of a convicted defendant who has had a full and fair trial but is later able to convince a court that he is ‘actually’ innocent.”</blockquote>
Finally, I have to share a laugh with a <a title="YouTube: Best People's Court Ending Ever" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pbfs2lYM2sQ">video</a> that makes me laugh heartily.
