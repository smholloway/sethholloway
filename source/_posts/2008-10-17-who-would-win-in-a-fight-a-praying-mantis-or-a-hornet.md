If you're anything like the guys over at <a title="Japanese Bug Fights" href="http://www.japanesebugfights.com/" target="_blank">www.japanesebugfights.com</a>, you've probably asked yourself this question before. To find out the answer, check the footage out <a title="Mantis vs Hornet" href="http://www.japanesebugfights.com/10.htm" target="_blank">here</a>.

Notes:

	 * I am not a Biologist; I don't know what kind of critters the fighters are.
	 * The footage may be disturbing if you're an equal-opportunity animal lover.
	 * The site is weird.

I watched a few of the battles and was surprised by some of the outcomes.

Seeing the bug fights, I'm tempted to start my own gladiatorial site: http://www.plantbattles.com/. I'll plant two different species in the same pot and see who will win! I think dandelions will overtake poison ivy, but you'll have to stay tuned to find out!
