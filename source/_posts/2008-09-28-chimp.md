A while back I read about Chi.mp, a site that promises to aggregate personal data and represent you. I got into the beta so now I am officially <a title="sethholloway.mp" href="https://chi.mp/s/sethholloway.mp/" target="_blank">https://chi.mp/s/sethholloway.mp/</a> or <a title="Seth Holloway on Chimp" href="http://www.sethholloway.mp" target="_blank">http://www.sethholloway.mp</a>.

This is all part of the shady control of all domain names owned by the Northern Mariana islands (read more at <a title="Wikipedia .mp Domain" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.mp" target="_blank">wikipedia</a>). A crafty business person is trying to make .mp the domain for social networking.

Despite all that, I like the idea of having one portal to myself. That's why I bought the <a title="seth holloway" href="http://www.sethholloway.com" target="_blank">sethholloway.com</a> domain; however, I understand the reasoning for a random person, with or without their own domain, to have an official portal. I'll give the Chi.mp beta program a shot and see how I feel later.
