Tortellini is a a dream to cook because the little pasta float when they're done. While spaghetti can go from a perfect al dente to soggy with no warning, tortellini Â tell you when they're done. Voila! I love it :)

Are there any other foods that are so obviously ready? What foods are you thankful for?

Update: Mussels! Not only are they sustainable, they open when they're ready. Brilliant!
