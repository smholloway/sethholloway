The Russian stock market has <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/globalbiz/content/sep2008/gb20080917_169033.htm" target="_blank">lost over 64% since July</a>. I guess I don't feel so bad anyway. One interesting point is that a falling stock market is a vicious cycle that reinforces its own failure. I'd love to find out how we'll stop the same problem here.
