<a title="Whoops" href="http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-fraud20-2008oct20,0,3842357.story" target="_blank">Here's a fun story</a> about a prominent republican who registers people to vote and is himself guilty of registration fraud--whoops.

The left-leaning L.A. Times mentions that the culprit, Mark Jacoby, leads a firm called Young Political Majors (YPM) which is known to bait and switch people into registering as GOP members. The lawyers are saying the arrest was "political" which I assume is a clever pun...

This year's election seems to be bringing the whackos out of the woodwork!
