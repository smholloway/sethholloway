 * Today's top story on CNN is about how <a title="Palin going rogue" href="http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/10/25/palin.tension/index.html" target="_blank">Palin is going against her own campaign</a> in an effort to save herself a shot for president in 2012.
 * Another about Palin's incompetency: She may not even be <a title="Palin does not know about government" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqBUbHsr070" target="_blank">smarter than a 3rd grader</a>.

This could be because <a title="Fire the banks" href="http://firedoglake.com/2008/10/25/banks-we-have-better-things-to-do-with-that-money-you-gave-us-than-lend-it-out/" target="_blank">banks have better things to do with their free money</a> than lend it to Joe Sixpack.
