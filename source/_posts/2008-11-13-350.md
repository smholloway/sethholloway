I've previously wondered if <a title="wikipedia AIDS" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIDS" target="_blank">AIDS</a> and <a title="wikiepedia leukemia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia" target="_blank">Leukemia</a> would cancel each other out. That may not make sense on the surface, but AIDS attacks <a title="wikipedia C4 T cells" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_helper_cell" target="_blank">C4</a> T cells, which are <a title="wikipedia lymphocyte" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocytes" target="_blank">lymphocytes</a>, and Leukemia is an unchecked proliferation of <a title="wikipedia Leukocytes" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukocytes" target="_blank">leukocytes</a> (white blood cells) which includes lymphocytes. In my uneducated estimation, the excess of white blood cells produced by Leukemia could be enough to counteract the white blood cells killed by AIDS.

Apparently this does not work. An American living in Berlin had AIDS and Leukemia simultaneously. The patient is notable because he has been <a title="Wired.com article on AIDS treatment" href="http://news.wired.com/dynamic/stories/E/EU_MED_AIDS_TREATMENT" target="_blank">"cured" of AIDS</a> after receiving a bone marrow transplant. TheÂ  article does not mention whether or not Leukemia is cured, but I assume it is. We definitely need to step up research on genes and stem cells!
