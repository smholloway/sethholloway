Assuming <a title="IQ basics" href="http://www.iqcomparisonsite.com/IQBasics.aspx" target="_blank">IQ follows a normal distribution</a>, the smartest third of India outnumber the entire population of the United States of America; the smartest quarter of China outnumber the entire population of the US.

This point was countered by an Indian friend of mine who pointed out that "it does not matter because half of India is illiterate." I'm not sure that's true, but I know that the above fact made me go "hmm..."

This is potentially damning for countries that do not have sheer numbers as a resource. What do you think? Will nations with the highest population achieve global dominance or is there something more to the equation?
