Today I heard about a neat new web app: <a title="SUMO Paint" href="http://www.sumo.fi/products/sumopaint/" target="_blank">SUMO Paint</a>. It's no Photoshop (or Inkscape if you like free!), but the features are pretty solid and it provides a lot of options for importing/exporting.

SUMO Paint represents a big advancement in online capabilities. We'll soon be able to do everything online--"in the cloud"--from any computer with an Internet connection. Cool!
