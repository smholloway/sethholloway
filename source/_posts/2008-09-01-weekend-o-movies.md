This weekend we saw <a title="Tropic Thunder IMDB" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0942385/" target="_blank">Tropic Thunder</a>, <a title="Forgetting Sarah Marshall IMDB" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0800039/" target="_blank">Forgetting Sarah Marshall</a>, and <a title="Talladega Nights on IMDB" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0415306/" target="_blank">Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby</a>. All three were worth watching and hilarious! Incidentally, I ranked them in order of descending hilarity above. And I'm justified because the <a title="Internet Movie Database" href="http://www.imdb.com" target="_blank">IMDB</a> voters seem to agree!

Recently I had been thinking that we did not have enough comedies. It turns out I just hadn't seen them! These movies represent a general cross section of the comic superstars of the past 10 years. We're missing a few big names like Adam Sandler, Vince Vaughn, Steve Carell, and the South Park guys; however, we get Ben Stiller, Will Ferrell, Jack Black, the Judd Apatow crew (Paul Rudd, Jason Segel, Bill Hader, Jonah Hill, etc) and a few newcomers. This year's MTV Movie Awards host, Russell Brand, was funny (not laugh out loud, but pleasant smile) in Forgetting Sarah Marshall. Also, after Pineapple Express (which was also hilarious, although a little long) I'm a big fan of Danny McBride--"thug life!" Danny was funny in Tropic Thunder. Although I don't think of him as a comediam per se, Robert Downey Jr. was a riot.

And now the baby Jesus and I are off to drink some Booty Sweat energy drink while watching the musical Dracula. (That's right, all three movies alluded to in one genius sequence of words).

Happy Labor Day!
