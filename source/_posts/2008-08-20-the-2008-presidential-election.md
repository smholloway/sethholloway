Well, the campaign trail is heating up (meaning talk of the Olympics and Russia's invasion of Georgia have taken a back burner) as Obama and McCain announce their running mates. I'll preface my comments by saying that I am fiscally conservative and socially liberal--in other words, libertarian. (I believe that everyone follows that same ideology (whether they realize it or not), but that's beside the point.) I believe in a multi-party system where with candidates who have solid opinions and personal integrity. As such, I will not vote for either of the two major contenders, but I still have a few comments about each.

<a title="Trust in Wikipedia!" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McCain" target="_blank">McCain</a>

When is the last time he even <a title="McCain has an awful lot of NV (no vote cast)" href="http://www.votesmart.org/voting_category.php?can_id=53270" target="_blank">did his job as a senator</a>? Can we really trust him to do his job as president, or will he <a title="Bush set a record for most vacation" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/08/02/AR2005080201703_pf.html" target="_blank">spend months on his ranch</a>? Beyond his less than stellar track record, he's using some old-school negative advertisements. Finally, the guy is old. Considering him as an average white male who is almost 72, <a title="US Gov Data on Life Expectancy" href="http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hus/hus07.pdf#027" target="_blank">he has about 10 years left</a>. Personally, I want someone with a little more vigor.

<a title="Trust in Wikipedia!" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obama" target="_blank">Obama</a>

He's young and naive. I'm worried that the candidate campaigning for change is moving more and more to the center--where politics have been for years. An entire generation behind this charismatic rock-star politician. Imagine their dismay when the candidate for change turns out to be the same-old hack. He already <a title="you know the story" href="http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/Story?id=4443788" target="_blank">abandoned his pastor of 20 years</a>, what's to say he won't continue to slough off the very things we believed in him for? Someone should make Obama <a title="Kerry Flip Flops" href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2004/09/23/MNGQK8TI8O1.DTL" target="_blank">flip-flops.</a>

Second, as an American who has traveled abroad in the past eight years, I know how much the rest of the world dislikes us. We have to repair our tarnished image. The Clinton war machine would have been a better choice on this front.

In the end, it's not up to me; it is up to everyone. May the best person win.
