I bought a PS3 as a media server: a central hub that would manage my entertainment. I struggled for days with <a title="WMP11 Official Site" href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/player/11/default.aspx" target="_blank">Windows Media Player 11</a>. <a title="Orb Official Site" href="http://www.orb.com/" target="_blank">Orb</a> solved my problems; however, I ran into issues with it. Broadly, Orb allows users to watch their media from anywhere. Orb is an amazing product! Just not what I needed.

The easiest method to setup the PS3 as a media server is <a title="TVersity Official Site" href="http://tversity.com/" target="_blank">TVersity</a>! You can find two good tutorials <a title="TVersity on PS3" href="http://www.ps3forums.com/showthread.php?t=75081" target="_blank">here</a> and <a title="TVersity on PS3 tutorial" href="http://weblog.bbzzdd.com/2007/08/04/optimizing-tversity-for-the-ps3-part-i/" target="_blank">here</a>. The most recent guide I've followed, <a title="TVersity on PS3 with subtitles" href="http://davieslim.wordpress.com/2008/07/20/tversity-to-ps3/" target="_blank">here</a>, helps set up subtitles as well.

No matter what product you use, you'll likely have to adjust your OS firewall and your router's open ports. Luckily, the Google serves up the information quickly and easily. If you run into problems, let me know and I'll try to help. Good luck and enjoy!
