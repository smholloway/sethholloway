Recently I came across a link to <a title="Type Analyzer" href="http://www.typealyzer.com/index.php?lang=en" target="_blank">Type Analyzer</a>, a website that will analyze the text of a webpage and tell you what <a title="Wikipedia: Myers-Briggs" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers-Briggs_Type_Indicator" target="_blank">Myers-Briggs</a> category it falls into. After analyzing my blog, Type Analyzer concluded that I was INTP. Recently, <a title="Seth Holloway: Personality Type" href="http://sethholloway.com/blog/?p=83" target="_blank">a personal inventory yielded ENTP</a>, so I guess Type Analyzer works pretty well. If you don't remember, <strong>E</strong> stands for extrovert and <strong>I</strong> for introvert. The constants are N (intuitive), T (thinker), and P (perceiver). Here's their report verbatim:
<h2>INTP - The Thinkers</h2>
<div style="float: left;"><img title="INTP" src="http://www.typealyzer.com/images/INTP.gif" alt="" /></div>
The logical and analytical type. They are espescially attuned to difficult creative and intellectual challenges and always look for something more complex to dig into. They are great at finding subtle connections between things and imagine far-reaching implications.

They enjoy working with complex things using a lot of concepts and imaginative models of reality. Since they are not very good at seeing and understanding the needs of other people, they might come across as arrogant, impatient and insensitive to people that need some time to understand what they are talking about.

What personality type are you? What about your website?
