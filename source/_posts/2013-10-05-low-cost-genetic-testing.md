I recently spit into a cup so that <a title="23 and Me" href="http://refer.23andme.com/a/clk/18h5Np">23andme</a> can perform genetic tests. It's a surreal feeling: for about $100, I gain access to some sci-fi dream that was completely unheard of even a decade ago.

The future is going to be an awesome place!
