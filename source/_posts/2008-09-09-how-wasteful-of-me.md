I found a link for the <a title="Quicken Spare Change Challenge" href="http://quicken.intuit.com/personal-finance-tips/quiz-spare-change-challenge-money-management.jsp" target="_blank">Quicken Spare Change Challenge</a>. The 42 questions are pretty obvious, which is sad because according to their calculator, I waste $556 a month! To be honest, there were a few items that I did not think much of, but I suppose that is the nature of savings: every bit counts.

I encourage you to take the quick quiz and see if there's anything wasteful that you're not aware of.

And in parting, one of my favorite pieces of advice: "Waste not, want not!"
