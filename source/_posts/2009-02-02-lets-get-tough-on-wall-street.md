Maureen Dowd says it nicely in <a title="Disgorge, Wall St Fat Cats" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/01/opinion/01dowd.html?_r=1&amp;ex=1391230800" target="_blank">her editorial</a> in the New York Times. If you didn't read the post already, you should. America needs to get upset, take action, and save the proletariat--not the fat cat. If the big banks fail, the free market will provide and there's no shortage of smart people looking to make banking salaries. These guys <a title="Efficient Market Hypothesis" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient_market_hypothesis" target="_blank">don't know anything special</a>, well not in terms of stock trends at least--I doubt you know about million dollar bonuses, private jets, and $100+ bottles of wine :)
