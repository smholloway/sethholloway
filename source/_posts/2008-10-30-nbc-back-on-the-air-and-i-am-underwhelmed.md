It seems that NBC is now back on the air here in Austin. This comes after weeks of <a title="NBC is offline" href="http://sethholloway.com/blog/?p=148" target="_blank">not getting the local NBC affiliate</a>, KXAN. Andrea discovered the change last night with the always memorable <a title="Deal or No Deal" href="http://www.nbc.com/Deal_or_No_Deal/" target="_blank">Deal or No Deal</a>. If you're curious, the right answer was <em>no deal</em>.

I cannot find details of the settlement, but the KXAN site does mention <a title="KXAN note to Time Warner customers" href="http://www.kxan.com/generic/news/TimeWarnerCustomerInformation" target="_blank">a fair resolution</a>. In the end, both sides lost because I'm annoyed at their bickering which affected the services I received. Now that NBC is back, I realize I did not miss it.
