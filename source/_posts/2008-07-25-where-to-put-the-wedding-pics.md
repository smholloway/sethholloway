<a title="Drs Julien blog" href="http://drsjulien.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Christine</a> had a very logical idea... post the <a title="mire holloway wedding pics pt 1" href="http://thenicholsblog.com/2008/07/08/andrea-seth/" target="_blank">wedding pictures</a> on the <a title="mire holloway wedding page" href="http://www.sethholloway.com/wedding.html" target="_blank">wedding website</a>. So, the link to our first round of wedding pics is now up there. We've also been told that the full set should be available within the next week. You'll have a link as soon as I do! If anyone else has any good ideas, please let me know!
