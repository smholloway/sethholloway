There are so many Groupon clones, but they seem to be missing something: choice.Â Stop feeding me random daily deals and let me pick what I want!

The state of the art seems to be deal aggregator sites that pull from Groupon, LivingSocial, Google Offers, Clickedin, and all the other daily deal sites. That's a start, but what's next? Maybe a deal search engine...

Where's the marketplace for a consumer to specify what they want and have companies compete? Say I want laser hair removal, a service that has been offered on all the deal sites, but I don't want to wait for the offer to come up. As far as I know, there's no way to get the deal on demand (I'm not even sure you can sign up to be notified when such a deal comes into existence).

Companies want customers. Consumers want to buy certain items. Why use these cheap tricks and middlemen?
