<a title="Lane Holloway" href="http://www.laneholloway.com/" target="_blank">Lane</a> isn't the only one changing his theme! After upgrading to the impressive new Wordpress 2.7 I found the beautiful <a title="Wordpress Theme: Gears" href="http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/gear" target="_blank">Gears theme</a> and edited it to fit my tastes. I hope you enjoy the updated look. Integrating <a title="Google Analytics" href="http://www.google.com/analytics/" target="_blank">Google Analytics</a> into the new theme took a couple tweaks, similar to <a title="Seth Holloway: Let Google do the Heavy Lifting" href="http://sethholloway.com/blog/2009/02/19/let-google-do-the-heavy-lifting/" target="_blank">putting Analytics into the default theme</a>. If you need help adding Analytics to Gears, send me a message and I'll try to help.

So, what do you think? Is Gears, as customized by yours truly, not wicked awesome?
