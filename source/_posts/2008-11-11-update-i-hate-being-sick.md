<a title="Seth Holloway I Hate Being Sick" href="http://sethholloway.com/blog/?p=329" target="_blank">Yesterday</a>, I felt terrible. Today, I'm recovering nicely. I may even be able to leave the house tomorrow!

I'm not sure what did me in, although I've considered an infection from my biking accident or residual effects of the flu shot. Ultimately, I think it was just a stomach bug that hit while my body was weakened.
