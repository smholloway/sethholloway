Tonight, I had the distinct pleasure of watching the Super Bowl with my in-laws who happen to be huge Saints fans. Congratulations to the Saints on an amazing victory! As they say (technically, spell) in New Orleans, Geaux Saints! And thanks to my new family for letting me enjoy the festivities with them. I'm sorry that <a title="Andrea Holloway" href="http://andreaholloway.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Andrea</a> was not here to celebrate with us, but we'll watch it again from the DVR when she returns :)
