This week I found an old friend, Dave Hoyt, on facebook. Dave was a great inspiration to my young mind; he was smart, well-read, intellectual, and a great debater. It's been ~8 years since we last hung out and I'm proud to say we'd still get along.

With introductions aside I'd like to direct you to Dave's premier piece of journalism: <a title="Dave Hoyt: Bailout Redux" href="http://www.thecypresstimes.com/article.cfm?articleID=19576" target="_blank">Bailout Redux</a> in <a title="The Cypress Times online" href="http://www.thecypresstimes.com/index.cfm" target="_blank">The Cypress Times</a>. The article is nicely written; it covers a range of topics around the recent economic woes, the disconnect between the citizenry and the rulers, and the <a title="Michael Boatright dot Com" href="http://michaelboatright.com/?p=40" target="_blank">duty of voters</a>--all in characteristically catchy prose. I encourage you to check it out. Here's a taste: "In the current economy, optimism may be the commodity most demanded and least supplied. Peddlers in optimism should do well."
