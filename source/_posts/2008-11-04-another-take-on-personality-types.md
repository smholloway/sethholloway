<a title="Personality Types" href="http://sethholloway.com/blog/?p=83" target="_blank">Previously</a> I posted about personality types using the Briggs/Meyers/Jung test. On that system I am an ENTP (Extroverted Intuitive Thinker Perceiver). Another take on personality types, which is also based on Jung, was recommended: The Enneagram. A nice description can be found <a title="enneagraminstitute.com homepage" href="http://www.enneagraminstitute.com/intro.asp" target="_blank">here.</a> If you don't want to read the full description, here's the abridged version:

<a href="http://www.enneagraminstitute.com/images/E-TypesName.gif"><img title="Enneagram Graphic" src="http://www.enneagraminstitute.com/images/E-TypesName.gif" alt="Enneagram visualized" width="367" height="190" /></a>

<blockquote>Type <strong>One</strong> is principled, purposeful, self-controlled, and perfectionistic.

Type <strong>Two</strong> is demonstrative, generous, people-pleasing, and possessive.

Type <strong>Three</strong> is adaptive, excelling, driven, and image-conscious.

Type <strong>Four</strong> is expressive, dramatic, self-absorbed, and temperamental.

Type <strong>Five</strong> is perceptive, innovative, secretive, and isolated.

Type <strong>Six</strong> is engaging, responsible, anxious, and suspicious.

Type <strong>Seven</strong> is spontaneous, versatile, distractible, and scattered.

Type <strong>Eight</strong> is self-confident, decisive, willful, and confrontational.

Type <strong>Nine</strong> is receptive, reassuring, agreeable, and complacent.</blockquote>

A thorough test can be found <a title="similarminds.com enneagram test" href="http://similarminds.com/embj.html" target="_blank">here</a> and a shorter version <a title="similarminds.com shorter enneagram test" href="http://similarminds.com/cgi-bin/similarminds.pl" target="_blank">here</a>.

Based on the long test I am a Type One or Type Eight. I mention both because the scores were like 73% for Type One and 71% for Type Eight; the difference is not statistically significant in my opinion and I'm not sure which one I'd rather claim ;-) With either type I fall into the Instinctive category (as opposed to Thinking or Feeling).

So what type are you?

Learning about yourself is fun! Understanding yourself and your surroundings is one of the tenets of philosophers from Socrates to Shakespeare to Rand. Because it is so important, there are a lot of versions of personality type; for example, Frued also has a number of tests. If you're interested, you can find a more exhaustive list <a title="similarminds.com list of personality tests" href="http://similarminds.com/personality_tests.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
