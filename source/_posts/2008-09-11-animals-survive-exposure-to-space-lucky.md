Last night I caught about 5 minutes of the <a title="Spike online" href="http://www.spike.com/network/spike" target="_blank">Spike</a> show <a title="Manswers " href="http://www.spike.com/group/manswers" target="_blank">Manswers</a> (potentially NSFW) and they asked, "How long could you survive in space without a spacesuit?" The correct answer was 1.5 minutes. According to Manswers, no human has ever been subjected to space without a suit; however, astronauts did throw dogs into the void of space "for science." Surprisingly, pooches do not fare any better than we humans do.

What Manswers didn't mention was <a title="wikipedia water bears" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tardigrada" target="_blank">water bears</a>, or Tardigrade. Tardigrade are eight-legged animals about <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">1cm</span> 2mm long that live in water. These strange little creatures are all over the place, but I don't remember learning about them in school. I wish I had because Tardigrade are freaks of nature! They make Biology sound interesting ;)

From the wikipedia article: "Tardigrades are able to survive in extreme environments that would kill almost any other animal. Some can survive temperatures close to absolute zero<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tardigrada#cite_note-3">[4]</a></sup>, temperatures as high as 151°C (303°F), 1,000 times more radiation than any other animal<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tardigrada#cite_note-4">[5]</a></sup>, nearly a decade without water, and even the vacuum of space.<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tardigrada#cite_note-5">[6]</a></sup>"

I actually found out about water bears through an interesting article on Wired, <a title="Wired.com article on water cows" href="http://blog.wired.com/wiredscience/2008/09/invertebrate-as.html" target="_blank">Invertebrate Astronauts Make Space History</a>, about water bears surviving in space without any protection. Basically, scientists put Tardigrade in a box, strapped it to a satellite, and let the little guys orbit the Earth. The water bears survived based on amazing biological processes like 1) slowing their metabolism down to 1/10,000 the normal rate and 2) repairing cellular damage caused by cosmic radiation. One day, scientists may even know how water bears do it; until then, bask in the glory of Tardigrade:

If you look closely you'll see the little guy is smiling. We can only assume he's saying, "I am biologically superior to billions of other species!
