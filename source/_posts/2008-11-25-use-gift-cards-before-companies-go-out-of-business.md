In these tough economic times we've heard about companies laying off employees and closing. The news has been so frequent that I'm already somewhat desensitized; however, there are some angles that I had not considered. Case in point, gift cards to companies going out of business are now use-it-or-lose-it. Andrea and I got several gift cards for the wedding and I generally get gift cards for Xmas and birthday, so I have a few saved up. Here's a list of companies that are in trouble, so look to spend those certificates!
