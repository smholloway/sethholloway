If I were asked for just one music recommendation, my choice would be <a title="official site" href="http://www.mikedoughty.com/" target="_blank">Mike Doughty</a>. Mike is the enigmatic "Doughty", the lead singer of now defunct acid-jazz/rock/folk/hip-hop band <a title="soul coughing on wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soul_Coughing" target="_blank">Soul Coughing</a>. If you're looking for music done right, check Mike out!
