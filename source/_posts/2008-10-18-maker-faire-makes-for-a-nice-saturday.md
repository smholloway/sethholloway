Today I visited <a title="Maker Faire homepage" href="http://makerfaire.com/" target="_blank">Maker Faire</a> with a few labmates (<a title="Making Software Useful" href="http://dstovall.com" target="_blank">Drew</a>, <a title="big on cycling and Internet anonymity" href="http://www.texascycling.org/" target="_blank">Tony</a>, Nick, and Patty). Student tickets are a very reasonable $15. There's plenty to see and do. I particularly enjoyed the food samples, pyrotechnics, <a title="No more gears! amazing system" href="http://www.fallbrooktech.com/03_bicycle.asp" target="_blank">cycles </a>, and <a title="Human controlled robots make war" href="http://makerfaire.com/austin/2008/robogames/info/" target="_blank">robot wars</a>. I would recommend that anyone interested in science and/or making stuff check it out. I hope to attend again next year.

Now I'm watching UT defend their number one NCAA ranking. Hook 'em Horns!!!
