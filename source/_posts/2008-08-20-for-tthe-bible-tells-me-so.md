This week Andrea and I watched an <a title="8/10 on IMDB" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0912583/" target="_blank">excellent</a> documentary on homophobia titled "<a title="official website" href="http://www.forthebibletellsmeso.org/index2.htm" target="_blank">For the Bible Tells Me So</a>". The film shows how little people know about the Bible verses that they use to justify hatred. You hear the tale of many different people and wraps things nicely in the end. While the story centers around homosexuality, the overriding themes can be applied to any bigoted subject. It is very politically correct and liberal, but I was moved.

A number of recent documentaries are made more watchable by tying the vignettes together to tell a story. Combine our love of reality TV with our desire for a plotline, and viola! instant classic.
