I've been using Internet radio/social music for quite a while now; I didn't think much of it until I noticed a friend using iTunes' 30 second clips to sample new music. There's no need for that! There are plenty of websites that provide the entire song for free. How do they do it? Some aggregate the plethora of mp3s available online (try searching google for your favorite song + mp3 and you'll see what I mean); others pay royalties for all the songs they offer; others are magick. In any case, you can enjoy the rewards risk-free.

A few examples that offer music for free over the intarwebz are <a title="Last.fm" href="http://www.last.fm/" target="_blank">Last.fm</a> and <a title="Pandora" href="http://www.pandora.com/" target="_blank">Pandora</a>; these are great places to find new music because they'll play/suggest new music based on what you're listening to.

If you know what you want to hear, <a title="imeem" href="http://www.imeem.com/" target="_blank">imeem</a> and <a title="Seeqpod" href="http://www.seeqpod.com/" target="_blank">Seeqpod</a> allow you to create your own playlists. I've had very good luck finding songs I want to hear (I've found 90% of songs I search for). imeem even allows you to export the player similar to embedding YouTube videos; here's a sample of a random playlist:

<object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="500" height="400" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="wmode" value="transparent" /><param name="src" value="http://media.imeem.com/pl/amfxhxhZgi/" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="500" height="400" src="http://media.imeem.com/pl/amfxhxhZgi/" wmode="transparent"></embed></object>

Enjoy! And if you have other suggestions, I'd love to hear them!
