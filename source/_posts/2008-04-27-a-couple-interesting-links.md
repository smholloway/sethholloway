For the first time in my life, including the past seven years in Austin, I have been suffering from allergies. Earlier this year I was congested and miserable for three weeks before going to the doctor; she told me to clear up my allergies I should use a saline nasal spray. Since then I've been more interested in the subject and I stumbled upon <a title="the neti pot will solve all your problems" href="http://www.persistenceunlimited.com/2006/03/how-to-nuke-your-seasonal-allergies/">this article</a> proclaiming the many benefits of regularly using a neti pot. I'm not to the point where I can pour water in one nostril and let it drain out the other, but I'm warming up to the idea ofÂ  nasal sprays...
