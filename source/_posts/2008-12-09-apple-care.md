Does anyone have experience with <a title="http://www.apple.com/support/" href="http://www.apple.com/support/" target="_blank">AppleCare</a>? More precisely the <a title="http://www.apple.com/support/products/proplan.html" href="http://www.apple.com/support/products/proplan.html" target="_blank">AppleCare Protection Plan</a>? Is it worth $250 to <a title="http://www.apple.com/support/macbook/service/" href="http://www.apple.com/support/macbook/service/" target="_blank">insure a modern MacBook</a> against natural failures? Will they blame me for the computer's failing and not cover the damages?
