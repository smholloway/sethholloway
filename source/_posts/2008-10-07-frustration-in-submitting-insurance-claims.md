I recently purchased contact lens from <a title="1800Contacts Web Site" href="http://www.1800contacts.com/" target="_blank">1800Contacts</a>. Now, I'm trying to submit a claim to my vision insurance, <a title="Super Vision Homepage" href="http://www.superiorvision.com/" target="_blank">Superior Vision</a>. I am frustrated that the only claims options are fax or snail mail! I have no reason to believe that I will not receive my money, but I'm frustrated at the lack of options at filing the claim.

Over the past several years I have been asked to fax a form. Everytime, I'm left wondering who has a fax machine handy?

Furthermore, when will companies embrace the digital revolution? I've scanned the receipt and my insurance card, but there's no email address that I can send it to. Using digital methods would save me, the consumer, and the company time and frustration.

Also, if fax machines are still being used widely, why is there not an open standard for email-to-fax machines?
