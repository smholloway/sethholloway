[The Road by Cormac
McCarthy](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OI0G1Q/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B000OI0G1Q&linkCode=as2&tag=theven01-20&linkId=GO6FQAOF57SDDYD4). A short but powerful book--I see why it was made into a movie. Turns out the apocalypse is no fun.

[God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater by Kurt
Vonnegut](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005IHWBSY/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B005IHWBSY&linkCode=as2&tag=theven01-20&linkId=27ID6XF3TZLBRUHR). I'm ashamed to admit that this is my first Vonnegut book. I've broken the seal, and I enjoyed it. The book has a socialist bent, so I'd love to hear what a strong capitalist thought of this book.

[Gone Girl by Gillian
Flynn](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006LSZECO/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B006LSZECO&linkCode=as2&tag=theven01-20&linkId=CTUBO5ECTNQJQN3S). I finished this before seeing the movie. My overall reaction is, "wow." I didn't like it, then liked it, then loved it, then didn't like it. It was original and well written, for what that's worth.
