I recently got accepted to the <a title="Clicker.com" href="http://www.clicker.com/" target="_blank">Clicker.com</a> beta. Clicker is a promising way to watch TV online, through a single portal. In their words:
<blockquote>
<h3>What is Clicker?</h3>
Clicker is the complete guide to Internet Television. Our mission is to make it simple for you to find the right show, right now.

As massive amounts of programming move online, consumers entering a world of infinite choices, all on-demand. Great! Finding the show you want to watch? Painful. Thousands of episodes from thousands of shows are housed on thousands of different sites, mixed among billions of random clips and videos.

Clicker catalogs all broadcast programming online, along with TV-quality Web originals, from these silos and delivers them in one seamless, organized experience so you can easily discover what's available to watch (and what isn't) online, where to watch it, and what's worth watching.</blockquote>
I'm lucky enough to have five invitations to share, so if you're interested follow the link and sign up: <a title="Clicker Invites: First come, first served" href="http://www.clicker.com/invite/Z4LwmGGNN71Cp8OO0QKw7w" target="_blank"> http://www.clicker.com/invite/Z4LwmGGNN71Cp8OO0QKw7w</a> (first come, first served)

May Clicker succeed in their mission and help reforge television!
