I came across a "<a title="Common Sense Fix" href="http://www.daveramsey.com/media/pdf/the_common_sense_fix.pdf" target="_blank">common sense fix</a>" for the economy that I found interesting. In particular, I like the idea of removing capital gains taxes:

<em>"Remove the capital gains tax completely. Investors will flood the real estate and stock
market in search of tax-free profits, creating tremendous—and immediate—liquidity in
the markets. Again, this costs the taxpayer nothing."</em>

I'm not sure that anyone is staying out of the market for fear of paying 15% tax, but it would be simple to waive gains taxes for 2008.

Ramsey also thinks we should stop paying incentives for CEO failures. I agree. Sure enough, Wall Street has already taken the government's money and <a title="Executives are getting $$$" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2008/oct/17/executivesalaries-banking" target="_blank">paid itself hefty bonuses</a> :'(
