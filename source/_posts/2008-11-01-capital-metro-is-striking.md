Friday I received this ominous email:

<em>Attention:  All Members of the UT Austin Community</em>

<em>At 10am on October 31, 2008, the University was notified by Capital Metro
that a strike of the operators of the mainline bus routes was imminent.  The
notification states that the strike will begin on Wednesday, November 5,
2008.  There is not currently a scheduled end date for the strike...</em>

Upon further investigation I saw (from the <a title="Capmetro.org" href="http://www.capmetro.org/" target="_blank">official Capital Metro site)</a>:

<span><span style="color: red;"><strong>"Service Advisory –</strong>Amalgamated Transit Union Local 1091, which represents most of Capital Metro’s bus operators and mechanics, has called a strike beginning Wednesday, November 5."</span></span>

No word of the strike is on the <a title="Amalgamated Transit Union" href="http://www.atu.org/" target="_blank">Amalgamated Transit Union site</a>, but I imagine they are protesting low wages/poor working conditions/the usual.

Yet another reason that public transportation does not catch on here: the workers strike! Rather than ride overcrowded, infrequent buses I will ride my bike or have Andrea take me to school. I just hope the cold weather stays away long enough for me to ride to campus during the strike. In my case, cold weather means anything below 55 degrees Farhenheit :)
