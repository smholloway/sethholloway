I was thrilled to see this simple but <a title="Indoor bike mount" href="http://ikeahacker.blogspot.com/2008/02/stolmen-bike-rack.html" target="_blank">elegant indoor bike rack</a>. It's made from inexpensive parts but does not look cheap. As a person with less than enough room, an unobtrusive, cheap way to store my bikes is exciting. I am very impressed by the ingenuity. God bless Ikea hackers!
