Yesterday, I participated in a charity pub crawl to raise money for cancer research. The <a title="Crawl for Cancer official site" href="http://www.crawlforcancer.org/austin/index.html" target="_blank">Crawl For Cancer</a> event took place downtown, specifically West Sixth street. A group of 10 people raises $400, and in return received 20 pitchers of beer at 5 different bars. The crawl was

	 * a neat way to drive commerce to local businesses;
	 * a novel way to raise awareness and funds;
	 * a great way to meet people;
	 * a worthwhile way to get a t-shirt!

All-in-all, I had a blast. If you're interested, you should participate next year!
