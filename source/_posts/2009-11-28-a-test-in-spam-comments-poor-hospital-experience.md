My wife had a poor hospital experience on her trip to Thailand. After blogging about it, she was inundated with spam comments. I'm wondering if bots crawl for the title/body, or if the spam was compliments of cheap Thai labor eager to drum up new business. We'll see if this post yields similar results!

Update: so far, no new spam comments. I guess something is different...
