	 * <a title="Let them die" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/23/AR2008102303352.html" target="_blank">AIG is burning through money</a> from the federal bailout with no hopes of paying back taxpayers. Horray for the bailout! I guess I'm not surprised that this would happen at a time when schools no longer have grades and competitive sports are outlawed because they expose failure.


	 * Greenspan admits he was <a title="&quot;Greenspan recants&quot;" href="http://tbm.thebigmoney.com/articles/juicy-bits/2008/10/23/greenspan-recants" target="_blank">"partially" wrong</a> with his direction for the economy. This is dangerous because people are using Greenspan's admission as a way to trash capitalism; however, America is not a shining expample of laissez-faire markets. I'm not positive that unfettered capitalism works, but I don't think we've tried it yet. The greedy Wall Streeters were hardly Objectivists.


	 * McCain and Palin continue their <a title="McCain Palin can't debate so they character assassinate" href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/27343688/" target="_blank">despicable smear campaign</a>. Also, why is having an elite government a bad thing? If you haven't seen <a title="Idiocracy, the movie" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0387808/" target="_blank">Idiocracy</a> (the movie) before, watch it and vote for the most elite our nation has to offer--for the future's sake.
