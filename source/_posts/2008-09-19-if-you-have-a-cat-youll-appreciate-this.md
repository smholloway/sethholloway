I get a real kick out of <a title="Sneaky cat!" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLIPWjks_M " target="_blank">this simple video</a> (via <a title="Geekologie Ninja Cat..." href="http://www.geekologie.com/2008/09/ninja_cat_is_mad_stealthy_will.php" target="_blank">Geekologie</a>). It's a cat is stalking its owner, very sneakily. I have not seen moves like this since <a title="Wikipedia Red Light Green Light" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_light,_green_light" target="_blank">Red Light Green Light</a> in third grade!

My cat doesn't have to be as stealthy--he has enough mass and strength to overwhelm any phantom he encounters--but the video is still really cute.

On a somewhat related note, I'm told that the kitty is actually an amazing hunter as recent animal psychology research says that prey animals scan for changes in the landscape. The cat's ability to maintain the same posture and be completely still make it an amazing predator. If you're interested in that idea, animals scanning their surroundings is discussed in depth in <a title="Amazon of Book" href="http://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Pictures-Other-Reports-Autism/dp/0679772898" target="_blank">Thinking in Pictures: and Other Reports from My Life with Autism</a>.
