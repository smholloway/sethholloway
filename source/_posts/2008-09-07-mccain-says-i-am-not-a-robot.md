McCain gave his acceptance speech at Thursday night's RNC. The first thing I noticed was how stiff he was: his shoulders crooked and hunched, his arms hung languidly at his sides. He walked out and started his speech. For over 30 minutes he spewed basic rhetoric and rallied the troops. Unfortunately, this portion was lackluster and forgettable.

However, the mood suddenly changed and McCain told about his time as a prisoner of war in Hanoi during "Vee-eht-naaaam." I knew he was a POW, but I did not know the details. His story was moving and delivered with great passion. He capitalized on the moment nicely and wrapped up the speech with a full head of steam.

I'll give it up to gramps; he did a good job and proved he is not a robot. He is old and pretty poor at reading off the teleprompter, but overall he came across mentally fit. As I've said before, I don't think he's got too many years left, but his 96 year old mother helps set a precedent for old-age in his family.

So what about the issues?

McCain talks about saving people money, but his tax plan <a title="Obama saves me more $$$" href="http://www.bargaineering.com/articles/obama-vs-mccain-tax-plans-obama-saves-you-more.html" target="_blank">benefits only the rich</a> (when compared to Obama's plan). Personally, I want less government and lower taxes. Obama's tax plan seems to do that better than the old Straight Talk Express.

There's a lot of talk about how we cannot tell the candidates opinions because they never voted. Well, Christine said <a title="Christine's take on presidential candidates" href="http://drsjulien.blogspot.com/2008/09/lies-and-misleadings.html" target="_blank">this</a> better than I can, so I'm going to share: "Obama has missed 45.5% of the votes (a lot, to be sure). McCain has missed 63.8%. That's more missed votes than Tim Johnson, who suffered a brain hemorrhage in December. (<a href="http://projects.washingtonpost.com/congress/110/senate/vote-missers/">Numbers</a> from the Washington Post.)"
