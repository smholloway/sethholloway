As the Fall semester starts, the MPC group has gained a few new students. As is tradition in the lab, we engage in a great deal of intellectual discourse about the world, culture, programming, science, research, and academia. Over the years I've been gifted some amazing articles, so I thought I'd document them here for other academic thinkers, or, at worst, my own memory.

As an aside, I appreciate when professors make use of their tenure and take bold, public stances (though I don't always agree with the stance). Some of these articles are edgy, but they'll make you think.

I have another few essays to post, however, they don't quite fit the general theme here so I'll save them for later. Without further ado, the reading list (in no particular order):

 * <a title="Asians can't think by Kanazawa" href="http://personal.lse.ac.uk/Kanazawa/pdfs/EP2006a.pdf" target="_blank">No, It Ain't Gonna Be Like That</a> (PDF) by Kanazawa
