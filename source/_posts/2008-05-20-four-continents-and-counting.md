I researched Google APIs recently. The <a title="google charts" href="http://code.google.com/apis/chart/" target="_blank">Google Charts API</a> was particularly intriguing so I decided to map the countries I've been to. Below you should see my four continents (ten countries) I've been to. In the coming months I should see another continent or two! Soon, I will have been to all six inhabitable continents :)
