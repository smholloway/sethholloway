There are <a title="Pictures of cars being stored in random places" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/unsold-cars-around-the-world-2009-2" target="_blank">A LOT of unsold cars worldwide</a>. From the pictures you can understand how every car company, except Subaru, is <a title="Autoblog: 2009 is rough for car companies" href="http://www.autoblog.com/2009/03/03/by-the-numbers-february-2009-wish-it-were-a-leap-year-edition/" target="_blank">hurting financially</a>!

We are in for a radical shift in the way people buy cars, and the existing excess supply will be worthless. Car companies should drop the unions, sell the backlog off at any price, and embrace the future.

There are a couple great TED talks on the subject:

	 * <a title="Wikipedia: Larry Burns" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Burns" target="_blank">Larry Burns</a>, VP of R&amp;D at GM, <a title="TED: Larry Burns" href="http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/reinventing_the_car.html" target="_blank">talks about the future of cars</a>: sleek, customizable, and powered by hydrogen. Great ideas; let's see if GM can follow through.
	 * <a title="Wikipedia: Amory Lovins" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amory_Lovins" target="_blank">Amory Lovins</a>, chairman of the <a title="Wikipedia: Rocky Mountain Institute" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocky_Mountain_Institute" target="_blank">Rocky Mountain Institute</a>, <a title="Amory Lovins on TED" href="http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/amory_lovins_on_winning_the_oil_endgame.html" target="_blank">proposes a great plan to reduce our dependency on oil</a>, and in doing so, says that vehicles should be smaller, lighter, and stronger.
