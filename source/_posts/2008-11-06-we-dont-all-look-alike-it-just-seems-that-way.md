I'm a big fan of Psychology; in fact, I've seriously considered getting a degree in Psychology. Alas, I'm going to have a PhD in engineering, so Psychology must wait. In the meantime, I like to read about the field as time permits. I just read a <a title="Why do they all look alike?" href="http://www.apa.org/monitor/dec00/lookalike.html" target="_self">very interesting article</a> about perceiving other races. In 2000 psychologist, Levin, posited that humans first perceive race then move into further reviews. Up until this work people accepted that humans acquired "perceptual expertise" about their own race.

Levin's research points to the fact that people perceive race as a whole rather than individual characteristics when looking at other races. To counteract the way your brain works you have to reexamine another race's facial feature and key in on differences.
