Here's a bit of news I found absolutely amazing: <a title="WoW" href="http://www.ripten.com/2008/10/10/wow-whore-has-36-accounts-raids-by-himself/" target="_blank">a guy, Bradster, has 36 WoW </a>(World of Warcraft) accounts that he plays by himself! He plans to wreak havoc on enemy players in massive PvP battles. Here's his setup:
<img src="http://www.ripten.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/wow-36box2-1.jpg" alt="11 computers playing 36 WoW accounts" />

This phenomenon is known as <a title="Wikipedia Multiboxing" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-boxing" target="_blank">multiboxing</a>; I saw it in previous MMORPGs, but it has really taken off in <a title="WoWiki on Multiboxing" href="http://www.wowwiki.com/Multiboxing" target="_blank">WoW</a>. I have played as many as four accounts at once and I know someone who routinely plays five together, but 36 accounts is dedication!

As Bradster says, 'there are more expensive hobbies than WoW.' Good luck in your struggles, Chummers.
