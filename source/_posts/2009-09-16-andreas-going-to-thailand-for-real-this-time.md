After <a title="Seth Holloway: Andrea's Adventures" href="http://sethholloway.com/blog/2009/07/29/andreas-adventures/" target="_blank">one false alarm</a>, Andrea got her new school. It looks like she will truly be going to <a title="Andrea Holloway: Here we go again" href="http://andreaholloway.wordpress.com/2009/09/15/here-we-go-again/" target="_blank">teach English in Thailand for a semester</a>. I'm very proud of my wife for her noble (and discomforting) pursuit :)
