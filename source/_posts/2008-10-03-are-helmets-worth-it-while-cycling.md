After <a title="seth holloway dot com post" href="http://sethholloway.com/blog/?p=144" target="_blank">posting yesterday</a>, I explored the <a title="How We Drive Blog" href="http://www.howwedrive.com/" target="_blank">How We Drive Blog</a> more. There's a <a title="Helmets make you safer?" href="http://www.howwedrive.com/2008/10/01/to-wear-or-not-to-wear-and-is-that-even-the-right-question-ian-walker-on-cycle-helmets/" target="_blank">fascinating article</a> by a research scientist who tried to determine if wearing a helmet makes us safer. The short answer, no one knows.

To summarize, it may actually be better to <strong>not </strong>wear a helmet because people will be more aggressive around you if you are wearing a helmet. Cyclists are also riskier because of a perceived increase in safety. (Psychological research says that monotony and repetition lull us into feeling safe; apply that to cyclists who do everything "right" and have never been in an accident.) Additionally, most cyclists die with head and chest injuries; no helmet can help your crushed torso.

Arguing for helmet, they will help with slow speed crashes and self-induced falls.

I got a chuckle from this bit: <em>A bicyclist visited their doctor with a damaged knee following a crash. “You should have been wearing a helmet,” says the doctor sternly. “How would that have saved my knee?” replies the cyclist.</em>

So, does wearing a helmet make you safer? Hard to say!
