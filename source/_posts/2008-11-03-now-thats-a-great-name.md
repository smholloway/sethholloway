A bored <a title="Terrible names" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/3369609/Teenager-changes-name-to-Captain-Fantastic.html" target="_blank">19 year old changed his name</a> to  <em>Captain Fantastic Faster Than Superman Spiderman Batman Wolverine Hulk And The Flash Combined</em> because he "wanted to be unique."  The article also has some other unique names like 4Real and Superman.

If you need a unique name to be unique, you're missing the point.
