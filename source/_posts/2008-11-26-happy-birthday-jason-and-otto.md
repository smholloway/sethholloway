I can't be around to celebrate with Jason or Otto, so I decided to give them the best virtual present I can, my well-wishes: happy birthday! I hope you guys got everything you wanted :)

On a side note, what's up with me having friends with the same birthday? Off the top of my headÂ I can think of six friends who share a birthday!
