TL;DR: If you see "PWAT N AUSTIN MOTO AUSTIN TX" on your statement, it's probably Painting with a Twist (PWAT).

Looking over my credit card statement I saw "PWAT N AUSTIN MOTO AUSTIN TX" and had no idea what it was. The random words made no sense to me.Â To make it even more confusing, my bank was categorizing the company as "Organizations - MISC SCHOOLS / EDUCATIONAL SERVICES"

Searching for the entire string led to results that were really keyed in on "MOTO AUSTIN" for some reason, which led to a lot of dead ends (we did not pay for motorcycle lessons or rent a motorcycle!).

After more searching I realized this charge is for <a title="Painting with a Twist" href="http://www.paintingwithatwist.com/">Painting With A Twist</a>! With that said, Painting With A Twist is a lot of fun. Andrea and I were able to quickly create some decent looking paintings in a relaxed environment.
