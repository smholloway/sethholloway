After several months of hard work and mental drain, Andrea and I spontaneously decided to take a trip. We scoured the web for deals and ended up in Belgium and Holland a couple weeks later. We had a wonderful 10 days! The weather was perfect; the people were nice; the food was great; all around wonderful! I feel reinvigorated :)

Andrea captured my sentiments nicely in <a title="Andrea Holloway: Wij komen naar Amsterdam en België" href="http://andreaholloway.wordpress.com/2010/09/14/wij-komen-naar-amsterdam-en-belgie/" target="_blank">her blog post about our recent vacation</a>. There, you can enjoy the 100  pics (trimmed down from ~400) in a nice little slideshow. Here's one of highlights: the <a title="Rate Beers overall rankings" href="http://www.ratebeer.com/RateBeerBest/bestbeers_012010.asp" target="_blank">best beer in the world, Westvleteren 12</a>.
