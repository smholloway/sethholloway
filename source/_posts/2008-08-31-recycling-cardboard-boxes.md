Do you have an old cardboard box laying around? Why not turn it into a <a title="evil mad scientist labs: cat chaise" href="http://www.evilmadscientist.com/article.php/catchaise" target="_blank">chaise lounge for your cat</a>? Really clever. Really ridiculous.

Don't have a cat? The pattern could be made to fit a dog or a baby I'm sure :)

If anyone wants to go into business, I bet we could sell these things at <a title="Bark 'n Purr" href="http://www.barknpurr.com/" target="_blank">Bark 'n Purr</a>!
