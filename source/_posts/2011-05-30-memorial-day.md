Rather than think about previous wars, I've been thinking about <a title="Seth Holloway blog: R.I.P. Viola Holloway" href="http://sethholloway.com/blog/2010/05/18/r-i-p-viola-holloway/">my grandma who died about a year ago</a>. She had lung cancer despite never smoking. After radiation and chemotherapy, she was cancer free. Later, she started to have balance issues that we thought were related to blood pressure. It turned out the cancer had spread to her brain. As a healthy, active 89 year old we encouraged her to get surgery. She pulled through and was rid of cancer once again. Unfortunately, the brain surgery recovery included a great deal of steroids. The steroids weakened her intestines. Ultimately, the intestines ruptured and that's bad. She went from being the most active, fun almost-90-year-old that I've ever met, to dead seemingly overnight. Truthfully, there were months of slow, painful decay in a hospital. I hope others can avoid this experience.

Happy Memorial Day!
