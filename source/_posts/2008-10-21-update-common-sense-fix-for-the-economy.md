Well, one <a title="SethHolloway.com: Common Sense Fix" href="http://sethholloway.com/blog/?p=210" target="_blank">common sense fix</a> for the economy was to drop capital gains taxes. Another one I found and really like is <a title="Wired.com Note to President" href="http://blog.wired.com/cars/2008/10/wall-street-bai.html" target="_blank">building infrastructure</a>.

<em>"A report card issued three years ago by the American Society of Civil Engineers <a href="http://www.asce.org/reportcard/2005/index2005.cfm">gives it all a D</a>. The society says we've got to spend about $1.6 trillion just to bring things up to a B-."</em>

Comments after the article reveal a lot of fiscal conservatism which I normally agree with. However, in my opinion a government should provide defense and infrastructure. The US is behind on health care, education, and technology (broadband Internet and cell phone services to name a couple). In order to maintain our position of power/esteem (I know people worldwide hate USA so I'm not sure what word to use, but you know what I mean), we must invest in infrastructure. America is too spread out to develop fully, but we can focus heavily on urban areas.

As a grad student I think we also need to increase research expenditures :)

This proposal is mired in long-standing debates and historical blunders, but I believe investing in infrastructure is a step in the right direction. I strongly believe that with the right systems in place, economic opportunities are infinite. Our odd blend of public and private systems is failing and needs serious reform.
