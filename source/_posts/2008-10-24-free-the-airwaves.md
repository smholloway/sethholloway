The government has meddled far too long by regulating the electromagnetic spectrum! TV broadcasters were given premium real estate on the spectrum; now that TV has gone digital, the spectrum should be freed. The physical properties of the "white spaces" make it an ideal candidate for wireless innovation.

"<em>Just as Wi-Fi sparked a revolution in the way we connect to the web, freeing the "white space" airwaves could help unleash a new wave of technological innovation, create jobs, and boost our economy.</em>"
