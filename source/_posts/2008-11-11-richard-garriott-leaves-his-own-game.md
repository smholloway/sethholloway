<a title="Wikipedia Richard Garriott" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Garriott" target="_blank">Richard "Lord British" Garriott</a>, has announced that <a title="Garriot leaving NCSoft" href="http://www.rgtr.com/news/latest_news/an_open_letter_from_general_br.html" target="_blank">he is leaving NCSoft</a> and the game that bears his name, <a title="Tabula Rasa Official Site" href="http://www.rgtr.com/index.html" target="_blank">Richard Garriott's Tabula Rasa</a>. Garriott recently accomplished his lifelong dream of <a title="Richard In Space" href="http://www.richardinspace.com/" target="_blank">traveling into space</a>, and he's now looking to focus his efforts on new projects.

I've been a big fan of Lord British since my days as an <a title="UO Official Site" href="http://www.uoherald.com/news/" target="_blank">Ultima Online</a> (UO for those in the know) junkie. UO was and is an amazing game (no, I don't play anymore). Beyond the game, he's owns some amazing properties around Austin. Years ago he would host lavish Halloween parties at his castle residence in Austin. By the time I found out about the event the parties had stopped, so I drove by the house and partied by myself.

The man is a game designing genius and I'm sad to hear that he's leaving the field but I wish him all the best. Godspeed Lord British!
