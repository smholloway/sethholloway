Reading <em>ars technica</em> today, I saw an article entitled "<a title="ARS Technica: New form of entanglement" href="http://arstechnica.com/science/news/2009/10/new-form-of-entanglement-plays-with-time-and-energy.ars" target="_blank">New form of entanglement plays with time and energy</a>." It sounded cool and important, from what I could understand. I skimmed the article, then I clicked on the <a title="Paper link" href="http://scitation.aip.org/getabs/servlet/GetabsServlet?prog=normal&amp;id=PRLTAO000103000016163601000001&amp;idtype=cvips&amp;gifs=yes" target="_blank">link to the paper in Physical Review Letters</a> and what did I find? The article was talking about work done by one of my oldest and dearest friends, Steve Sensarn. I'm blown away by the caliber of Steve's work and the fact that a prominent site like <em>ars</em> would cover the research. Congratulations to Steve! Time to step my game up and do something magazine-worthy :)
