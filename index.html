      <p>Free-form notes from a presentation by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B._J._Fogg">BJ Fogg</a> on <a href="http://www.behaviormodel.org/">behavior change</a></p>

<p>Behavior happens when you have <em>motivation</em>, <em>ability</em>, and a <em>prompt</em></p>

<p>To stop a behavior:
* reduce motivation
* make it harder
* remove prompt</p>

<p>To encourage a behavior:
* make it easy
* build onto existing routine
* re-wire your brain (find a way to celebrate)</p>

<p>This is a simple process but change is not easy. We should approach behavior change with compassion, playfulness, and iteration.</p>

      <p>Below are my favorite reads from 2017.</p>

<h3>Fiction</h3>

<ul>
<li><a href="">Reamde</a> by Neal Stephenson &ndash; I have enjoyed every Neal Stephenson book I&rsquo;ve read, and this is no exception. I&rsquo;ve played a lot of online games over the years, so this book hooked me by starting off with a computer virus spread in an online game. It develops nicely from there.</li>
<li><a href="">The Moon is a Harsh Mistress</a> by Robert Heinlein &ndash; Truly ahead of its time. This book felt modern with its space travel and artificial intelligence, but it was written in the 1950s!</li>
<li><a href="">Ancillary Justice</a> by Leckie &ndash; This book has won a ton of awards so it is not too surprising that it is good. It has some really interesting ideas with AI and consciousness.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Series</h3>

<ul>
<li><a href="">Super Powereds</a> by Drew Hayes &ndash; College kids with super powers. That&rsquo;s a hell of a mashup. I found the three published books very entertaining. The characters were interesting, the scenarios were realistic, and the magic system was well thought out and balanced (which is not easy to do with super powers).</li>
</ul>


<h3>Non-fiction</h3>

<ul>
<li><a href="">The Path To Power</a> and <a href="">Means of Ascent</a> by Robert Caro &ndash; These are the first two books in a long biography series about LBJ, one of America&rsquo;s most interesting presidents. Ryan Holiday recommended these and I see why. Amazing character and great writing make these books easy to read. It helped me feel better about today&rsquo;s political climate.</li>
<li><a href="">Ideal Team Player</a> by Lencioni &ndash; Lencioni has carved out a niche with his leadership fables&mdash;basically, business books wrapped in a narrative. I&rsquo;ve read most of his books now and they fit together really nicely. I want to be an ideal team player and this book gave me food for thought.</li>
<li><a href="">Anatomy of Peace</a> by The Arbinger Institute &ndash; Another business book wraped in a narrative. Peace is a great goal, so I was glad to learn more about how we can all overcome conflict and find peace.</li>
</ul>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/favorite-books-read-2016/">My favorite reads in 2016</a></h1>
      <p>Below are my favorite reads from 2016.</p>

<h3>Fiction</h3>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://amzn.to/1RX9aIm">Lord of All Things</a> by Andreas Eschbach &ndash; This book had a lot of new-to-me ideas and the sci-fi was integrated nicely into a story I enjoyed. One of the things that stands out is that tradeoffs exist with every choice.</li>
<li><a href="http://amzn.to/2ixJgRY">Seveneves</a> by Neal Stephenson &ndash; Amazing concepts that my mind keeps turning over. I love Neal Stephenson and this is yet another mind-expanding novel from him. This book really hit him as Elon Musk started speaking more publicly about getting off Earth.</li>
<li><a href="http://amzn.to/2in6xFW">Stories of Your Life and Others</a> by Ted Chiang &ndash; I don&rsquo;t tend to read many short stories, but I&rsquo;m glad I read this collection. About half the stories were really good and still have me thinking.</li>
</ul>


<h4>Series</h4>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://amzn.to/1YefYmk">Red Rising by Pierce Brown</a></li>
<li><a href="http://amzn.to/1UHiSBW">Riyria Chronicles by Michael J. Sullivan</a></li>
<li><a href="http://amzn.to/2iWcyur">Lightbringer series by Brent Weeks</a></li>
</ul>


<h3>Non-fiction</h3>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://amzn.to/294eAPo">Them: Adventures with Extremists</a> by Jon Ronson &ndash; A great story in the midst of a very extreme 2016.</li>
<li><a href="http://amzn.to/2hHFvrV">Surely You&rsquo;re Joking, Mr. Feynman!: Adventures of a Curious Character</a> by Richard Feynman &ndash; This is my new standard for an autobiography. Entertaining and interesting throughout, with great insights into this curious character. I particularly liked that he didn&rsquo;t want more money because it would allow him to afford mistress, which he knew would ruin his life.</li>
<li><a href="http://amzn.to/2iUcmre">Home Game: An Accidental Guide to Fatherhood</a> by Michael Lewis &ndash; I would recommend this to any new father. It&rsquo;s short and funny with Michael Lewis plainly saying so many things I had thought. I&rsquo;ve used his question &ldquo;what percentage of the parenting does each parent do?&rdquo; several times now. He says that fathers do much less than mothers but there&rsquo;s a lot of social stigma to admitting that, which made me feel better.</li>
<li><a href="http://amzn.to/2in8Et5">When Things Fall Apart: Heart Advice for Difficult Times</a> by Pema Chodron &ndash; This book dovetailed nicely with my efforts to control my emotions. I read no more than one chapter at a time because it&rsquo;s heavy, introspective stuff. I was thrilled that I read this beeok when I saw Derek Sivers mention Pema Chodron in his <a href="http://nownownow.com/about">about now pages post</a>.</li>
</ul>


<p>That&rsquo;s my not-so-short list of favorites from 2016. I hope 2017 will be filled with as many great stories.</p>

      <p>SXSW 2016 was great! I&rsquo;m enjoying the conference more every year. I think last year&rsquo;s presentations were more thought-provoking, but there were several good talks this year too.</p>

<h2>Friday</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://schedule.sxsw.com/2016/events/event_PP90088">Invisible Influence and Winning at SXSW 2016</a> &ndash; Contagious was <a href="http://sethholloway.com/favorite-books-read-2015/">one of my favorite books of 2015</a> so I was excited for his keynote. It was good. He played a clip from his appearance on <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2078690/">Brain Games</a> where the show manipulated people into waiting in line for nothing. That idea reminds me a lot of <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/derek_sivers_how_to_start_a_movement">Derek Sivers talk on how to start a movement</a> (which is awesome).</li>
<li><a href="http://schedule.sxsw.com/2016/events/event_PP93149">President Barack Obama Keynote Conversation</a> &ndash; Super cool that Obama was at South by. I really like the POTUS connecting with the people (as opposed to the standard, stuffy keep-the-voters-at-arm&rsquo;s length).</li>
<li><a href="http://schedule.sxsw.com/2016/events/event_PP91541">Google Self-Driving Car Project</a> &ndash; So cool. Last year&rsquo;s Moon Shots presentation by Dr. Astro Teller left me all warm and fuzzy about Google X, and this talk did too. I loved seeing the computer representation next to the camera version. The future is now. (I can&rsquo;t wait for self-driving cars.)</li>
</ul>


<h2>Saturday</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://schedule.sxsw.com/2016/events/event_PP46272">NativeScript: The Future of Mobile App Development</a> &ndash; Wanna write a single JavaScript program that can run on iOS, Android, and Windows phone? Then NativeScript is for you! It&rsquo;s a neat idea, and I think the fact that we keep seeing write-once-run-on-any-native-platform projects shows how valuable such a project would be.</li>
<li><a href="http://schedule.sxsw.com/2016/events/event_PP92018">The Future of Media Companies</a> &ndash; Hard to believe that a BuzzFeed speech would have a click-bait title, right?!</li>
<li><a href="http://schedule.sxsw.com/2016/events/event_PP92035">Daring Greatly</a> &ndash; To summarize: breathe. I&rsquo;m being flippant. Brene Brown is amazing and her keynote was no exception. One of my favorites.</li>
<li><a href="http://schedule.sxsw.com/2016/events/event_PP91923">Unstoppable Trends that are Changing the World</a> &ndash; Max, the co-founder and CTO of PayPal, is staggeringly smart. The presentation was good. The Q&amp;A was great. In the time it took to read a question, Max could come up with a brilliant, self-assured response that was delivered with precision. He invoked the idea of a shrewd, genius VC.</li>
<li><a href="http://schedule.sxsw.com/2016/events/event_PP48870">The Linguistic Secrets Found in Billions of Emoji</a> &ndash; I thought I could buy some nerd-cred with my wife with this one. I don&rsquo;t use emoji like most people use emoji :&ndash;\</li>
</ul>


<h2>Monday</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://schedule.sxsw.com/2016/events/event_PP51950">Comments Are Terrible: But They Don&rsquo;t Have to Be</a> &ndash; My favorite insight was that the architecture of comment sections can change behavior; for example, a three-column comment section containing <code>for</code>, <code>against</code>, and <code>questions</code> increased civility.</li>
<li><a href="http://schedule.sxsw.com/2016/events/event_PP58524">Bad Robot, Epic Digital, and Google Present Moon Shot. The story of the Google Lunar XPRIZE</a> &ndash; JJ Abrams introduced a series of shows chronicling a few teams going for the Google Lunar X prize. Great videos! I love how space is cool now.</li>
<li><a href="http://schedule.sxsw.com/2016/events/event_OE05413">Silent Room by Simon Heijdens</a> &ndash; Anechoic chamber. Whoa. I only got a minute inside but it was a really neat experience.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Tuesday</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://schedule.sxsw.com/2016/events/event_PP52737">The New Battle Over Encryption and How to Survive It</a> &ndash; Moxie Marlinspike is amazing. I don&rsquo;t know how someone so humble and idealistic has gained the spotlight, but I&rsquo;m so glad he has. I&rsquo;d rather listen to him than the standard pundit any day.</li>
<li><a href="http://schedule.sxsw.com/2016/events/event_PP57527">Cracking the Code to Your Unlimited Epic Potential</a> &ndash; To summarize: breathe.</li>
<li><a href="http://schedule.sxsw.com/2016/events/event_PP90100">Why Happiness Is Hard and How to Make It Easier</a> &ndash; To summarize: breathe.</li>
<li><a href="http://schedule.sxsw.com/2016/events/event_PP46758">The Secrets of Machine Learning Revealed</a> &ndash; A great summary of machine learning. I really liked how Dr. Domingos distilled the information stating the five schools of ML and their goals.</li>
<li><a href="http://schedule.sxsw.com/2016/events/event_PP57474">Closing Remarks: Bruce Sterling</a> &ndash; A SXSW tradition. This year&rsquo;s message seemed to be, &ldquo;by this time next year, Trump will be president, but the U.S. will survive.&rdquo; Bruce is an engaging, entertaining speaker full of energy and ideas.</li>
</ul>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/thoughts-on-android-and-ios/">Android vs iOS</a></h1>
      <p>As I work on Android and iOS I&rsquo;m refining my opinions. Below are my current thoughts about the two ecosystems and underlying languages.</p>

<h2>Objective C vs Java</h2>

<p>Note: I haven&rsquo;t used Swift enough to fairly compare Swift to Objective C. The presence of Swift calls into question the future of Objective C; however, I think Swift eliminates a lot of my gripes with Objective C.</p>

<h3>Objective C wins</h3>

<ul>
<li>Apple docs are generally more pleasant than JavaDocs.</li>
<li>You can pass messages to <code>nil</code> without a <code>NullPointerException</code>.</li>
<li><code>nil</code> is <code>false</code>, which fits how I generally think about problems and saves some typing (<code>if (foo)</code> is not as explicit but explicit null checks are noisy and easily forgotten).</li>
<li>Method names can be more expressive: <code>stringWithCString:inputString encoding:inputEncoding</code> is more clear to me than <code>String(String inputString, String encoding)</code>, which, in practice, is often more like <code>String(String s, String e)</code>. As the signature expands the problem becomes more pronounced. Objective C essentially forces named arguments.</li>
<li>Drama surrounding Java&rsquo;s future under Oracle; for example, Android Dalvik is definitely not Java <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalvik_(software)#Licensing_and_patents"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalvik_">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalvik_</a>(software)#Licensing_and_patents</a></li>
</ul>


<h3>Java wins</h3>

<ul>
<li>In wide use outside mobile development, so Java is well known and understood</li>
<li>Simpler memory management, which decreases the amount of syntax and leads to fewer bugs. This combined with the fact that Java is more widely used means that people can more easily ramp up on Android.</li>
</ul>


<h2>iOS vs Android</h2>

<h3>Android wins</h3>

<ul>
<li>Easy and inexpensive (a one-time $25 fee) to create and publish apps.</li>
<li>Registering to open URLs. In Android an app can register to open specific links, like <code>https://youtube.com</code> or <code>seth://foo</code>. This improves the user experience by operating on the link in the best app: if you have the YouTube app, open the video in the app, otherwise fall back to the default browser. iOS achieves a similar effect but cannot register for <code>https://</code> schemes. In practice it works well enough, but custom schemes aren’t as ubiquitous as HTTP(S).</li>
<li>Strings and localization. Android forces you to use a message catalog, which has several advantages: (1) it’s better for reuse; (2) it makes it easier to refactor; (3) it centralizes text so docs and translators can engage more easily; (4) the toolchain is more stable&mdash;Xcode crashes a lot when working with localization and it doesn’t update text changes made through interface builder</li>
</ul>


<h3>iOS wins</h3>

<ul>
<li>One true way to do most things. iOS is pretty strict, but it&rsquo;s easier to find the proper way to do things and leads to greater consistency.</li>
<li>More stable platform.</li>
<li>Higher quality apps and community, on average. While Apple&rsquo;s approval process is a pain and their developer program fees are steep (compared to Android&rsquo;s $0 cost), this probably leads to higher quality.</li>
</ul>

      <p><a href="http://www.thegreatcourses.com/courses/medical-school-for-everyone-grand-rounds-cases.html">Medical School for Everyone: Grand Rounds Cases (Great Courses) by Roy
Benaroch, M.D.</a></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Diseases like Down&rsquo;s syndrome and Ménière&rsquo;s disease are shifting to
drop the possessive noun, so you might hear Down syndrome, Ménière disease,
Alzheimer disease, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Doctors listen to symptoms then make a &ldquo;differential diagnosis&rdquo;, which
is essentially a working theory. They then test the theory to confirm
the diagnosis. (A &ldquo;differential diagnosis&rdquo; differentiates one particular
disease from other diseases that present similar symptoms; e.g., &ldquo;it
could be brain cancer or a stroke&mdash;differential diagnosis is stroke.&rdquo;)</p></li>
<li><p>Doctors should start with the most specific symptoms. For example,
&ldquo;stomach ache&rdquo; could be caused by hundreds of conditions while &ldquo;a large
lump in my abdomen&rdquo; has fewer causes.</p></li>
<li><p>Modern CPR recommendations are to lay the patient flat and begin
aggressive chest compressions&mdash;no rescue breaths&mdash;while getting others
to call 911 and seek an automated external defibrillator (AED). AEDs are
becoming more common. They instruct laypeople how to proceed and
administer shocks as needed.</p></li>
<li><p>Unexplained weight loss means your body is not absorbing nutrients
properly or is burning calories in an unexplained way. Diabetes and
cancer are common causes.</p></li>
<li><p>Don&rsquo;t assume that your doctors are communicating. Make sure that records
are shared between them and that they know about one another.</p></li>
<li><p>In emergency situations doctors use their A, B, Cs: Airway, Breathing,
Circulation, Disability, Exposure. These are handled in sequence. The
technique is meant to make a complex problem more tractable. If a
patient has a blocked airway, they first intubate (or whatever is
appropriate); if airway is clear they ensure the patient is breathing,
then that the patient&rsquo;s heart is working and the patient is not losing
blood. Disability assesses the patient&rsquo;s general competency, usually
using the AVPU method, where the patient is graded as alert (A), voice
responsive (V), pain responsive (P), or unresponsive (U). This is an
alternative to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasgow_Coma_Scale">Glasgow Coma
Scale</a>, which uses six
levels of eye, verbal, and motor (EVM) responses. Exposure is about a
more general physical exam, looking for signs of trauma.</p></li>
<li><p>They think King Tut died of sickle-cell disease (a.k.a. sickle-cell
anemia). Sickle-cell carriers are resistant to malaria, so it&rsquo;s a great
trait to have in places where malaria is a leading cause of death;
however, sickle-cell is more likely to kill so the benefits are lost if
a child inherits. (Sickle-cell is inherited in an autosomal recessive
pattern where two carrier parents have a &frac14; chance for the child to be
unaffected, 2/4 chance for the child to be a carrier, and &frac14; chance for
the child to have sickle-cell.)</p></li>

      <p>Below are the books I read in 2016 categorized as fiction or non-fiction. (The list is also available on <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/year_in_books/2016/48474315">Goodreads</a>.)</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve gone with a thumbs up/down rating to force myself to have an opinion because I&rsquo;m generally positive about any book I read and that&rsquo;s boring.</p>

<p>Want to squeeze in a few more books per year? I read a fair amount of physical and ebooks, but I rely on audiobooks to double my monthly reading. I use and love <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Audible-Free-Trial-Digital-Membership/dp/B00NB86OYE/?ref_=assoc_tag_ph_1422899139880&amp;_encoding=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=pf4&amp;tag=theven01-20&amp;linkId=DYWVSK5ZUM3CXNRC">Audible</a>.

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/favorite-books-read-2015/">My favorite reads in 2015</a></h1>
      <p>Different books give me different things, so it&rsquo;s hard to rank them. But here are a few books that stand out from this year&rsquo;s reading list.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The Stormlight Archive books 1 and 2 by Brandon Sanderson: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Way-Kings-Stormlight-Archive-Book-ebook/dp/B003P2WO5E/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1450818313&amp;sr=1-1&amp;tag=theven01-20">The Way of Kings</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Words-Radiance-Stormlight-Archive-Book-ebook/dp/B00DA6YEKS/ref=sr_1_2?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1450818313&amp;sr=1-2&amp;tag=theven01-20">Words of Radiance</a>. I read seven Brandon Sanderson books in 2015, so it&rsquo;s fair to say I enjoy his writing. This is set to be a 10-book epic fantasy series in the vein of <em>The Wheel of Time</em>, which Sanderson finished with aplomb. I hate having to wait so long to reach the conclusion, but I&rsquo;m prepared to do so because the first two were so good.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Trust-Me-Lying-Confessions-Manipulator-ebook/dp/B0074VTHH0/?tag=theven01-20">Trust Me, I&rsquo;m Lying by Ryan Holiday</a>. The media is bullshit&mdash;read this book if you don&rsquo;t believe me. Ryan Holiday talks candidly about the tricks he and so many others use to generate traffic.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/So-Youve-Been-Publicly-Shamed-ebook/dp/B00L9B7IRC/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1450818288&amp;sr=1-1&amp;tag=theven01-20">So You&rsquo;ve Been Publicly Shamed by Jon Ronson</a>. Between this and <em>Trust Me, I&rsquo;m Lying</em> I was really sad about the state of media and the rise of outrage porn. Real lives are ruined and only the media wins.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Art-Asking-Learned-Worrying-People-ebook/dp/B00IRISKD6/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1450818262&amp;sr=1-1&amp;tag=theven01-20">The Art of Asking by Amanda Palmer</a>. Another book with ties to shame and acceptance. Amanda Palmer has a confessional style that is really disarming. People have been really mean to her, so her message of love and empathy is that much more amazing.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Radical-Acceptance-Tara-Brach-ebook/dp/B000FC2NHG/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1450818241&amp;sr=1-1&amp;tag=theven01-20">Radical Acceptance by Tara Brach</a>. A breath of fresh air among the negativity in some of my other notable reads from the year. Reading this book made me feel better about myself.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Contagious-Things-Catch-Jonah-Berger-ebook/dp/B008J4GQKW/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1450817798&amp;tag=theven01-20">Contagious by Jonah Berger</a>. Contagious sheds light on why some things are shared and others aren&rsquo;t, which was particularly interesting in the context of shame and media manipulation.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Things-Shout-Out-Loud-Parties-ebook/dp/B00L2FG1SM/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1450817769&amp;sr=1-1&amp;tag=theven01-20">Things to shout out loud at parties. by Markus Almond</a>. I love the style of this book. It&rsquo;s a collection of no-more-than-one-page stories and thoughts so it&rsquo;s very approachable. I think everyone should aim to write a similar book.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Jesus-Son-Stories-Denis-Johnson-ebook/dp/B006JR7XLC/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1450817738&amp;tag=theven01-20">Jesus&#8217; Son by Denis Johnson</a>. Another book with a unique style. This one is a collection of stories about a junkie stumbling through life where the writing is as stark and jumpy as you&rsquo;d expect from a junkie.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Becoming-Technical-Leader-Gerald-Weinberg-ebook/dp/B004J4VV3I/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1450817692&amp;sr=1-1&amp;tag=theven01-20">Becoming a Technical Leader by Gerald Weinberg</a>. This book is unlike any other &lsquo;how to be a leader&rsquo; book that I&rsquo;ve read. It&rsquo;s full of great ideas like, &lsquo;maybe poor personal hygiene is about poor self-confidence so be mindful when offering advice&rsquo; and Satir&rsquo;s interaction model. I highly recommend it for anyone who is becoming a technical leader.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Phoenix-Project-DevOps-Helping-Business-ebook/dp/B00AZRBLHO/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=1450816934&amp;sr=1-1&amp;tag=theven01-20">The Phoenix Project by Gene Kim, Kevin Behr, and George Spafford</a>. A modern version of <em>The Goal</em>, which helped reinforce past learnings about project management and software deployments.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>I hope 2015 treated you well! I look forward to a similarly stimulating 2016.</p>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/daily-rituals-for-success/">Daily Checklist for Success</a></h1>
      <p>Personal rituals are fascinating to me. I&rsquo;ve encountered them repeatedly in books, blogs, podcasts, and conversations. They&rsquo;re generally boiled down to 1-60 minute morning rituals, but I chafe at the idea of an immutable hour-long routine because I have at least four different types of days (calm weekday, rushed weekday, calm weekend, and rushed weekend). It&rsquo;s easier for me to think of the idealized morning routine as a daily checklist that I can achieve in whatever order during any waking period.</p>

<p>This year I&rsquo;ve focused a lot on my own health and happiness, paying special attention to what drains me of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LnBvuzjpr4">my energy</a>. Through reading and experimenting I&rsquo;ve come up with my own checklist. These are the things that I shoot for every day (in no particular order):</p>

<ul>
<li>smile for one minute &ndash; Smiling feels good, and there&rsquo;s always something worth smiling about. But I rarely smile. I&rsquo;m generally happy, but I tend to suppress the physical representation of my emotions so I don&rsquo;t smile nearly as much as I&rsquo;d like to. I&rsquo;m working on making my outside match my inside more often.</li>
<li>journal 3+ things I&rsquo;m grateful for &ndash; I try to smile while thinking of things I&rsquo;m grateful for. It would be easy enough to say, &ldquo;my wife&rdquo;, &ldquo;my health&rdquo;, and &ldquo;my job&rdquo;, but I try to get more specific. Practicing gratitude has been very helpful for me.</li>
<li>journal anything I&rsquo;m proud of myself for &ndash; I struggle with self-confidence and self-compassion, so this running log of goodness helps me feel better.</li>
<li>breathe from the diagram, trying to take only 4-6 breaths in one minute &ndash; It&rsquo;s amazing how calm I feel after slowing my breathing&mdash;it&rsquo;s like telling your body, &ldquo;relax&rdquo; and having your body listen.</li>
<li>sleep 7.5+ hours &ndash; Sleep is generally the first thing to go when I get busy; however, I&rsquo;m finding that sleep really sets the stage for the day, so I&rsquo;m trying to sleep more.</li>
<li>stand 2+ hours &ndash; On my laziest day I could stand for less than five minutes, which is bad for my mood and my metabolism. I installed a flip-up table so I can work standing up. I&rsquo;m trying to stand once an hour (drinking a lot of water helps motivate me). I&rsquo;ve also been doing a lot of housework recently, so I&rsquo;m standing more.</li>
<li>walk at least 3,000 steps &ndash; You know that laziest day where I hardly stand? I definitely don&rsquo;t walk much those days. For reference 3,000 steps is roughly 1.5 miles and 30 minutes moving around. Since I made 3,000 steps a goal I&rsquo;ve been able to do it almost every day.</li>
<li>exercise until sweating &ndash; Typical exercise guidelines recommend around five hours of exercise per week, but most Americans are barely getting two hours, so I try to be realistic. I think &ldquo;until sweating&rdquo; is a better goal than any specific time. Get the blood moving and enjoy.</li>
<li>have sex &ndash; I never see this in people&rsquo;s daily routines, but I think it&rsquo;s very important so I had to include it. That said, this is probably my most skipped routine.</li>
<li>get some physical contact with loved ones (including pets) &ndash; Positive physical contact releases oxytocin, which makes us feel connected and warm. Blood pressure drops and we feel a sense of well-being. Pretty powerful stuff. I&rsquo;ve read various studies saying it takes from one second to two minutes, so I shoot for one good purposeful spouse-hug and a minute of cuddling with the pets.</li>
<li>take a probiotic &ndash; Get your shit straight. For real.</li>
<li>eat some fiber &ndash; See above.</li>
<li>fill in vitamins and minerals you have missed or will miss from your food and drink &ndash; I generally eat well for 3/5 feedings (traditional meals plus snacks), but I still miss a lot of nutrients. Vitamin D, which is usually provided by exposure to the sun, is chronically low among programmers. If I can&rsquo;t go for a little walk in the sun then I take my vitamin D.</li>
<li>drink 64+ oz of water &ndash; Studies refute the biological need for 8 cups of water, but I&rsquo;ve found that it&rsquo;s fairly easy and it makes me feel better.</li>
<li>brush your teeth twice &ndash; Your mother will be proud.</li>
<li>make your bed &ndash; For me, this helps set the stage for a productive day. I don&rsquo;t do anything fancy&mdash;just straighten the sheets and comforter and pull them up over my pillows.</li>
<li>stretch &ndash; My flexibility sucks. I think some of my body aches come from poor flexibility, so I&rsquo;m working to improve my general mobility.</li>
<li>communicate with someone important to me (preferably someone that I don&rsquo;t work or live with) &ndash; Relationships mean a lot to me, yet I&rsquo;m historically bad at keeping in touch. While far from perfect now, by focusing on it every day I&rsquo;ve been able to keep up with more loved ones.</li>
<li>meditate &ndash; I try to meditate every day, but &ldquo;meditation&rdquo; is a really open-ended idea. I&rsquo;ve found success in short mindfulness breaks. Focusing on breathing from my diaphragm, clearing my mind with intense exercise, and recognizing the blessings around me all achieve a similar effect for me.</li>
</ul>


<p>If you&rsquo;re on the fence about any item, run the experiment and see how you feel after trying it.</p>

<p>So, what&rsquo;s your daily checklist? What works for you? What percentage of your tasks do you normally complete?</p>
