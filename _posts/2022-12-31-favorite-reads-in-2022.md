I took something meaningful from almost all of the [36 new books I read in 2022](https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/33562347). For that, I am grateful.

I read some great fiction this year! I caught up on a couple Brandon Sanderson series ([Mistborn: Wax and Wayne](https://www.goodreads.com/series/123082-mistborn-wax-wayne) and [Skyward](https://www.goodreads.com/series/247635-skyward)) and read [The Legends of the First Empire Series by Michael J Sullivan](https://www.goodreads.com/series/135626-the-legends-of-the-first-empire).

On the non-fiction front I appreciated [Will Larson's Staff Engineer](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56481725-staff-engineer) book for capturing a number of important topics for technical leaders who don't go into management and [Lara Hogan's Resilient Management](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45767533-resilient-management) for capturing the basics for those on the management track. [The Sum of Us](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53231851-the-sum-of-us) and [Just Mercy](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20342617-just-mercy) helped me understand the past and present lived experiences of Black Americans, while [The Culture Map](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22085568-the-culture-map) helped me understand more about people from across the world. [Atlas of the Heart](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58330567-atlas-of-the-heart) helped me improve my emotional intelligence. [Become What You Are by Alan Watts](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22885236-become-what-you-are) and [Awareness by Anthony De Mello](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/94318.Awareness) bridged multiple spiritualities in a way that helped me feel more connected to my fellow humans.

I hope others can enjoy their reading as much as I did in 2022.
