In 2020 I [read 36 books](https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/20177731). I enjoyed most of them with a few standing out.

* [Thanks for the Feedback](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18114120-thanks-for-the-feedback) by Douglas Stone and Sheila Heen. This is the book that I have recommended the most from my 2020 reads. It is applicable to everyone from individual contributors to managers and parents to children. Some takeaways:
    * giving feedback is hard, so be grateful when you receive it
    * accept feedback without pushing back -- just say, "thanks for the feedback" -- later, seek to understand the feedback more deeply
    * act on good feedback and disregard bad feedback
* [The Manager's Path](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33369254-the-manager-s-path) by Camille Fournier. One of my favorite management books. The author describes roles from senior developer up through C-levels, so this work has value for every level of technical leader.
* [Thinking in Systems](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3828902-thinking-in-systems) by Donella Meadows. Everything is a system, and that includes companies. The people and processes in place make up a system, and people will learn to game that system. To make meaningful change, we have to understand and change those systems. We cannot simply apply the best ideas from a competitor and expect it to work because their system is different than ours.
* Brandon Sanderson's epic fantasy series, [Stormlight Archive](https://www.goodreads.com/series/49075-the-stormlight-archive) continued with [Rhythm of War](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49021976-rhythm-of-war), which was great. Who doesn't love a 1,200-page book?! â˜º
