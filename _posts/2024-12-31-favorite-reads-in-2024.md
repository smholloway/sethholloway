title: Favorite Reads of 2024
type: post

2024 was an incredible year, and I count myself blessed.

This year I read [20 books](https://www.goodreads.com/user/year_in_books/2024/48474315) with a non-fiction skew. I worked hard to improve myself mentally and physically. Beyond software leadership, meditationm and psychology, I dipped into sales.

My most recommended book of 2024 is [Outlive by Peter Attia](https://amzn.to/4gXCC17), which summarizes longevity research in an accessible, actionable way. I really enjoy Dr. Attia's framework, and have tried to strengthen my existing good habits and adopt new habits after reading this book. Here's to a long, meaningful life in 2025 and beyond!
