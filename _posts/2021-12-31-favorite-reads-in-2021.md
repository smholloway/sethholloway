This year [my reading](https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/26045181) skewed more towards non-fiction for whatever reason.

[Rise by Patty Azzarello](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12838919-rise) was the freshest leadership book I've read recently, with many helpful, applicable tips. I read several leadership fables by Patrick Lencioni, including [Death by Meeting](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49040.Death_by_Meeting), [The Motive](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51771754-the-motive), and [The Three Signs of a Miserable Job](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/749937.The_Three_Signs_of_a_Miserable_Job); those books were light, quick, and good, and they led me to [Overcoming the Five Dysfunctions of a Team](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/170485.Overcoming_the_Five_Dysfunctions_of_a_Team), which I drew upon to help my teams gel more during COVID. [Jocko Willink's Leadership Strategy and Tactics](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51136198-leadership-strategy-and-tactics) resonated with me by nicely defining the "extreme ownership" that I feel for my teams and providing strategy and tactics for how to improve myself to improve the team.

For fiction I was introduced to the genre of climate change sci-fi with [Neal Stephenson's Termination Shock](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55200380-termination-shock) and [The Ministry for the Future by Kim Stanley Robinson](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50998056-the-ministry-for-the-future), which I found thought-provoking though generally depressing. I read a few other good fiction books to even things out.
