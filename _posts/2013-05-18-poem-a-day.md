Some creative types advocate a method to increase creativity by writing a poem a day forevermore. Here's my effort to increase my creativity and avoid perfectionism.

<h3>Sunday</h3>
Haikus are easy

Not easy, but straightforward

I just penned one
<h3>Monday</h3>
Perfection is good

Shipped is preferable

Why not try for both?
<h3>Tuesday</h3>
Now uninspired

Creativity in waves

Better than ever
<h3>Wednesday</h3>
Sassy Daisy-May

Loves long walks, runs, and car rides

Cuddling next to me
<h3>Thursday</h3>
Social media

Ahhhhhh LinkedIn, Facebook, GitHub

Not enough time for them
<h3>Friday</h3>
Televise e-sports

Power to the nerdy folks

Stop praising athletes
<h3>Saturday</h3>
No photographs please

I am not wearing makeup

Wait, I never do


<h3>Sunday</h3>
Continue kicking ass

And you will be rewarded

By life and your peers
<h3>Monday</h3>
Anonymity

Increases your bravery

For better or worse
<h3>Tuesday</h3>
Whoa crazy lady

Are you really afraid of dogs?

No need to freak out
<h3>Wednesday</h3>
Bro, that's not haiku

Moras are not syllables

Pedantic diff'rence
<h3>Thursday</h3>
Mediocrity

Happens all too easily

Eat your own dog food
<h3>Friday</h3>
Exercise takes time

And food is so damn tasty

That's why I am fat
<h3>Saturday</h3>
Home maintenance sucks

Paychecks paid straight to my Lowe's

Days spent in the yard


<h3>Sunday</h3>
Countless thoughts to share

Until I'm at the keyboard

Then it just dries up
<h3>Monday</h3>
Off me hungry cat

I'll feed you when I wake up

Until then, shutup
<h3>Tuesday</h3>
Haters gonna hate

Eagerly trolling people

Keep daring greatly
<h3>Wednesday</h3>
You can do an'thing

Except defy gravity

That's natural law
<h3>Thursday</h3>
Onward and upward

Or perhaps out and over

Life's path's uncharted
<h3>Friday</h3>
Chinese twice today

Tongue and belly are happy

Heart and scale are mad
<h3>Saturday</h3>
Today I ran miles

Slow down, breathe, focus, and go

Push to run longer

<h3>Sunday</h3>
Can I make one rhyme

Easy enough this one time

Twice would be a crime
<h3>Monday</h3>
Authentication

Usable security

My new job, Toopher
<h3>Tuesday</h3>
Deer in the greenbelt

Just hanging out and sleeping

What a peaceful scene
<h3>Wednesday</h3>
What is modern rock?

Black Keys, Muse, Mumford and Sons

Radio needs variety
<h3>Thursday</h3>
Sunny and real hot

It is summer in Texas

Gonna get sweaty
<h3>Friday</h3>
Good end to the week

Kayaking to the sunset

Outdoors in Austin
<h3>Saturday</h3>
What the?! Up is down...

Stupid reverse scrolling Mac

Why do I love you?
