In 2023 I focused a little less on books, allowing myself more time for podcasts, lectures, talks, etc. I read [33 books](https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/40498483) across a variety of genres.

I was delighted by [Ross Gay's The Book of Delights](https://a.co/d/giopoOl) as well as [Brandon Sanderson's Surprise! novels](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dragonsteel/surprise-four-secret-novels-by-brandon-sanderson) (my favorite was [The Sunlit Man](https://a.co/d/2pVJli1) for its glimpse into the Cosmere).

I really enjoyed the [Elon Musk biography by Walter Isaacson](https://a.co/d/5Mlslmg) because it provided more context around one of the world's most news-worthy characters. 

My son and I read a few young adult books together, which marks a new chapter where we can enjoy the same things -- I love it!

Since having a child, I have enjoyed the thought exercise of deciding what advice I would capture and pass on, and I think [Kevin Kelly's collection of advice](https://a.co/d/bwCRh0o) is a great start.

Dr. Becky's viral parenting book, [Good Inside](https://a.co/d/2CFx1Fu), was one of my favorite non-fiction books and one that I would recommend to everyone. It helped me on my quest to get better every day.

2023 had its share of highs and lows. I am grateful for so many things, including an endless supply of fantastic reads. Here's to a wonderful 2024!
