This year I read [26 books](https://www.goodreads.com/user/year_in_books/2025/48474315), and looking back, a clear pattern emerged: I'm fascinated by systems -- whether that's the game mechanics of a dungeon crawler, the organizational charts of tech companies, or the neural wiring of my own brain.

Three themes dominated my reading:
1. **The "Level Up" Mentality**. From LitRPG series like Dungeon Crawler Carl and He Who Fights with Monsters to career guides like The Staff Engineer's Path, I kept gravitating toward stories of progression. The throughline? Life and work are systems that can be mastered and optimized through intentional effort.
2. **Mastering the Inner Landscape**. Between Scattered Minds, The Anxious Generation, Feeling Good, and Taming the Tiger Within, I spent significant time exploring the machinery of the mind. These books offered tools including CBT, mindfulness, and frameworks for maintaining emotional regulation in a chaotic world.
3. **Survival Strategy in High-Stakes Environments**. Whether navigating alien-imposed death games or corporate inflection points (Only the Paranoid Survive), my books featured underdogs forced to outsmart larger, often corrupt systems. The lesson: strategy isn't just about winning! It's about adapting when the old rules no longer apply.

Turns out, I like reading about people who treat life like a game they're determined to beat, one carefully chosen skill point at a time.
