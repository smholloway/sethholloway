      <p>After meeting a III I got interested in nicknames and learned a thing or two. Here&rsquo;s a quick list I compiled from people I&rsquo;ve met and information I found on the <a title="Wikipedia: Nickname" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nickname">intertubes</a> and <a title="Wikipedia: Suffix" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffix_(name)">wikifacegoogles</a>.</p>

<p>For the second: Junior, J.R., June, Chip, Duece, Two, Bud, &lt;First name initial&gt;.J. (e.g., Seth Jr. would be S.J.), Little &lt;Name&gt; (e.g., Little Seth), Younger &lt;Name&gt; (e.g., Younger Seth), Skip (particularly if the name skipped a generation), Sonny</p>

<p>For the third: Trip/Tripp, Trey/Tre, Skip/Skipper</p>

<p>Nicknames even extend to IV, V, and beyond! Maybe I would have learned this sooner if I lived with more WASPs in New England :) Have I missed any others?</p>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/scripting-heroku-backups/">Scripting Heroku backups</a></h1>
      <p>I was looking for a way to backup applications on Heroku and found a few options. There&rsquo;s a Rails plugin that stores your backups on Amazon S3 (<a title="Heroku S3 Backup plugin" href="https://github.com/edavis10/heroku_s3_backup"><a href="https://github.com/edavis10/heroku_s3_backup">https://github.com/edavis10/heroku_s3_backup</a></a>), but I am satisfied with local backups.</p>

<p>So I updated an existing solution (<a title="Ben Scheirman's blog" href="http://flux88.com/2010/02/scripting-heroku-backups/"><a href="http://flux88.com/2010/02/scripting-heroku-backups/">http://flux88.com/2010/02/scripting-heroku-backups/</a></a>) based on Heroku&rsquo;s updated documentation (<a title="Heroku Docs: pgbackups" href="http://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/pgbackups"><a href="http://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/pgbackups">http://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/pgbackups</a></a>).</p>

<pre># lib/tasks/backup.rake

# Create a backup of a Rails application deployed to Heroku
# Technique taken from Ben Scheirman - http://flux88.com/2010/02/scripting-heroku-backups/
# Place file in lib/tasks/backup.rake (replace your_app_name with your application's Heroku name)
# Invoke using rake your_app_name:backup
# Dependencies: the heroku gem, the pgbackups heroku addon
namespace :your_app_name do
    desc 'Captures a heroku backup. Ensure you have the heroku gem and pgbackups addon installed\n
                gem install heroku &amp;&amp; heroku addons:add pgbackups'

    task :backup do
        # capture the backup bundle
        timestamp = `date -u '+%Y-%m-%d-%H-%M'`.chomp
        bundle_name = "your_app_name-#{timestamp}"
        puts "Capturing bundle #{bundle_name}..."
        `heroku pgbackups:capture --app your_app_name '#{bundle_name}'`

        # download &amp; destroy the bundle we just captured
        puts "Downloading bundle #{bundle_name}.dump"
        backup_url = `heroku pgbackups:url`
        `curl -o '#{bundle_name}'.dump '#{backup_url}'`

        # move the backup
        puts "Moving bundle to backups/#{bundle_name}.dump"
        `mkdir backups/`
        `mv '#{bundle_name}'.dump backups/#{bundle_name}.dump`
    end
end</pre>


<p>I&rsquo;ve also uploaded the file to my github account: <a title="Seth Holloway's GitHub" href="https://github.com/smholloway/miscellaneous/blob/master/rails/backup.rake"><a href="https://github.com/smholloway/miscellaneous/blob/master/rails/backup.rake">https://github.com/smholloway/miscellaneous/blob/master/rails/backup.rake</a></a></p>

<p>There are a lot of things you could do to extend this further; for example, you could create a cron job to run the task periodically or schedule a few minutes every week to make the backups.</p>

<p>Let me know if you can improve this or if you find it useful.</p>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/people-selling-their-own-vehicles/">People selling their own vehicles</a></h1>
      <p>I&rsquo;ve become fascinated with the way that people signal they are selling their vehicles. Virtually everytime I drive somewhere, I see a car that is for sale by owner.</p>

<p>Here are a few styles I&rsquo;ve seen:</p>

<blockquote>$555-5555

This ambiguous note seems to say &#8220;for sale&#8221; by using a dollar sign ($) butted up against a phone number. The &#8220;for sale&#8221; and telephone number are not clear, so maybe that&#8217;s just the price range.</blockquote>




<blockquote>4-sale 555-555-5555

I like this one. If I saw this car while on a road trip, I&#8217;d know it was available and how to contact the seller.</blockquote>




<blockquote>sale 555-555-5555

Not bad, but are they selling their phone number? The note could be more clearly written.</blockquote>




<p><blockquote>180k $800 5555555</p>

<p>Without more context, I have to interpret this myself. I assume it means the seller wants $800 for their 180,000 mile car and they can be reached at 5555555 (or was that 555555 or 55555555?).</p>

<p><blockquote> $1000 OBO</p>

<p>Here, &ldquo;OBO&rdquo; means &ldquo;or best offer&rdquo; showing that the seller is negotiable on price. I tend to think most prices are negotiable, particularly when dealing with individuals, however, the &ldquo;OBO&rdquo; conveys a great willingness to work with the seller (probably a good thing). Should I just flag down the owner and negotiate while driving?</blockquote></p>

<p>The personal car advertisement brings up questions of usability and efficiency in generating sales. What&rsquo;s most effective? What information is necessary? I don&rsquo;t know, but here are a few thoughts:</p>

<ul>
<li>The only constant among the advertisements seems to be a phone number. I think this makes sense, since the buyer needs a way to contact the seller and make the transaction.</li>
<li>In general, I think it&rsquo;s short sighted to put only a 7 digit phone number. Cars, and the people contained within, are mobile. It&rsquo;s not unreasonable to think that you may leave your area code or have others enter yours.</li>
<li>Putting too much information feels counter-productive.</li>
<li>Numbers like price or number of miles are very hard to differentiate from phone number</li>
<li>It is very difficult to assess the vehicle and write down the phone number while driving, so stationary vehicles are probably more effective.</li>
</ul>


<p>I would recommend a clearly written advertisement on the back windshield that states the intention to sell (&ldquo;for sale&rdquo;) and a contact phone number (10 digits, appropriately separated with dashes). In conjunction, list your car on craigslists, ebay motors, zip zoom auto, and tell your friends verbally and over facebook. And one high-tech idea: put a QR code on a sheet of paper in the window. Boom!</p>

      <p>This post is a few weeks overdue. On May 20, I officially completed my PhD from The University of Texas at Austin, making me Seth Holloway, PhD. Pretty neat, huh? I have more to say about my work, academia, working while going to school, but it&rsquo;ll have to wait. For now, just a teaser :)</p>

<p>Note: The title is just a joke: I still respond to Seth. I&rsquo;m looking for more ways to incorporate the Dr. or PhD (or more correctly, Ph.D.), and there really aren&rsquo;t many. At least I&rsquo;ll have this blog post.</p>

      <p>As I see it, few professional organizations are worth it. I think professional organizations should work hard to provide value to their members. At this point there&rsquo;s not a lot that we need them for. Perhaps IEEE could increase their credibility by maintaining a list of up-to-date information written by industry leaders. That way, they may not have the industry leaders, but they at least acknowledge cutting-edge work and become a great central location. Maybe IEEE should be competing with Hacker News, Reddit, Digg, and Slashdot. Some other ideas for how they could add value: promotions (look at the App Store to learn how a big organization can help individuals flourish); local meetups; really solid job postings with matching and recommendations (and throw in career counseling available over the phone or chat); facilitate in finding funding for your tech work; &ldquo;Ask an expert&rdquo; chats. And my biggest wish as I embark on a journey into self-employment: group insurance. Why doesn&rsquo;t IEEE leverage its membership base to provide competitive health insurance? Insurance companies cannot reject individuals who buy in to a group plan, and it keeps the premiums low for the group. Want to add value? Provide an entrepreneurship insurance. They could probably flex their muscles and help skilled foreigners with visas. I&rsquo;m not a lawyer, but couldn&rsquo;t IEEE provide a service that costs the price of a visa sponsorship? Join our group and you can be sponsored for a visa for $PRICE_OF_VISA.</p>

<p>UPDATE: From what I can tell, IEEE does not currently offer group health insurance. They have spam mails for different insurance plans and they offer short-term medical through their site. The spam is obnoxious and the short-term medical is worse than what you can purchase easily online.</p>

<p>What do you think? How can professional organizations be more useful?</p>

      <p>Rather than think about previous wars, I&rsquo;ve been thinking about <a title="Seth Holloway blog: R.I.P. Viola Holloway" href="http://sethholloway.com/blog/2010/05/18/r-i-p-viola-holloway/">my grandma who died about a year ago</a>. She had lung cancer despite never smoking. After radiation and chemotherapy, she was cancer free. Later, she started to have balance issues that we thought were related to blood pressure. It turned out the cancer had spread to her brain. As a healthy, active 89 year old we encouraged her to get surgery. She pulled through and was rid of cancer once again. Unfortunately, the brain surgery recovery included a great deal of steroids. The steroids weakened her intestines. Ultimately, the intestines ruptured and that&rsquo;s bad. She went from being the most active, fun almost-90-year-old that I&rsquo;ve ever met, to dead seemingly overnight. Truthfully, there were months of slow, painful decay in a hospital. I hope others can avoid this experience.</p>

<p>Happy Memorial Day!</p>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/a-bit-about-music-theory/">A bit about music theory</a></h1>
      <p>I wrote a bit about music theory with respect to guitars for my brother and decided it was worth sharing.</p>

<p>Scales are a series of notes derived with a set pattern. The root note defines the scale. Let me explain further with two scales that only contain the natural notes (no sharps or flats): A minor and C major. A minor and C major are &lsquo;enharmonic&rsquo; meaning they are the same notes;  the difference between the scales is the root note and the pattern that you follow to find the next note. Observe:</p>

<div>
<div>
<blockquote>A minor scale

Notes: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, A

Frets on the E string: 5, 7, 8, 10, 12, 13, 15, 17

Pattern (intervals between notes): root, +2, +1, +2, +2, +1, +2, +2

C major scale

Notes: C, D, E, F, G, A, B, C

Frets on the E string: 8, 10, 12, 13, 15, 17, 19, 20

Pattern (intervals between notes): root, +2, +2, +1, +2, +2, +2, +1</blockquote>
</div>
</div>


<p>You can play a minor scale by picking the root note then applying the minor pattern: root, +2, +1, +2, +2, +1, +2, +2. In the same way, you can play a major scale by picking a root note then applying the major pattern: root, +2, +2, +1, +2, +2, +2, +1. Another example:</p>

<blockquote>A major scale

Notes: A, B, C#, D, E, F#, G#, A

Frets on the E string: 5, 7, 9, 10, 12, 14, 16, 17

Pattern (intervals between notes): root, +2, +2, +1, +2, +2, +2, +1</blockquote>


<p>In music theory terms, the +1 difference is called a &ldquo;half-tone&rdquo; difference and the +2 is termed a &ldquo;whole tone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If you play notes (mostly) from one scale, you are said to be in that key. For example, if you play notes (mostly) from the E scale, you&rsquo;re in the key of E (major is generally implied&mdash;minor must be stated).</p>

<p>From scales, we can derive chords. Chords are groups of notes. The basic chord is 3 notes: 1 (root), 3, 5 of the scale.</p>

<p>An A minor chord contains the notes A, C, E (1, 3, 5 of the A minor scale).</p>

<p>The C major chord contains C, E, G (1, 3, 5 of the C major scale).</p>

<p>And the A major chord contains A, C#, E (1, 3, 5 of the A major scale).</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s a quick, high-level overview of the basis of all music. Now, rock on! \m/</p>

      <p>IEEE, with slogans and taglines like &ldquo;The world&rsquo;s largest professional association for the advancement of technology&rdquo; and &ldquo;Advancing Technology for Society&rdquo; has lost its credibility. After being a member for 10 years, I can say I&rsquo;ve seen no benefits. In fact, I&rsquo;ve only encountered frustration like spam email, randomly assigned usernames that are hard to remember, and strictly enforced password policies that are less secure than my standards&mdash;making passwords impossible to remember. The website is ugly and hard to use. Want benefits like access to webinars? Sorry, that will cost extra. Doing research and trying to access an IEEE publication? Sorry, that will cost extra.</p>

<p>This came to a head recently when I checked the mail and saw an official looking envelope claiming membership information was included. This concerned me some, so I opened the envelope and found yet another junk mailing. No credible brand will allow spamvertising, much less spamvertising with their name all over it.</p>

<p>Sadly, IEEE promotes these services as an incentive to join. If these services are for my benefit, let me choose when to enact these benefits. <strong>IEEE is a cheap brand that sells its members&#8217; information</strong>. Their only claim to fame is convincing 400,000 people that their dues are low enough to endure. IEEE has lost its credibility: their information is late and incomplete&mdash;even worse, they charge inordinate amounts for research that might be timely and detailed.</p>

<p>There are so many worthwhile publications, blogs, and organizations; IEEE is not one of them. I will not be renewing my membership again. Will you? If so, why?</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span style="font-family: Consolas, Monaco, 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px; white-space: pre;">You won&rsquo;t be sad or broken tonight</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: Consolas, Monaco, 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px; white-space: pre;">you won&rsquo;t be squealed on, ripped off tonight</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: Consolas, Monaco, 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px; white-space: pre;">you won&rsquo;t be back-stabbed, double crossed, face down</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: Consolas, Monaco, 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px; white-space: pre;">teeth knocked out, lying in a gutter somewhere</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: Consolas, Monaco, 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px; white-space: pre;">So dream on&#8221;</span></p>

<p>Hahaha, I love it! I can&rsquo;t think of another song with such (openly) dark content that is so accessible to the masses (pop). The Eagles might have been singing about a brothel, but you could easily think it was just a nice hotel in the middle of nowhere!</p>
