      <h1 class="link"><a href="/a-bit-about-music-theory/">A bit about music theory</a></h1>
      <p>I wrote a bit about music theory with respect to guitars for my brother and decided it was worth sharing.</p>

<p>Scales are a series of notes derived with a set pattern. The root note defines the scale. Let me explain further with two scales that only contain the natural notes (no sharps or flats): A minor and C major. A minor and C major are &lsquo;enharmonic&rsquo; meaning they are the same notes;  the difference between the scales is the root note and the pattern that you follow to find the next note. Observe:</p>

<div>
<div>
<blockquote>A minor scale

Notes: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, A

Frets on the E string: 5, 7, 8, 10, 12, 13, 15, 17

Pattern (intervals between notes): root, +2, +1, +2, +2, +1, +2, +2

C major scale

Notes: C, D, E, F, G, A, B, C

Frets on the E string: 8, 10, 12, 13, 15, 17, 19, 20

Pattern (intervals between notes): root, +2, +2, +1, +2, +2, +2, +1</blockquote>
</div>
</div>


<p>You can play a minor scale by picking the root note then applying the minor pattern: root, +2, +1, +2, +2, +1, +2, +2. In the same way, you can play a major scale by picking a root note then applying the major pattern: root, +2, +2, +1, +2, +2, +2, +1. Another example:</p>

<blockquote>A major scale

Notes: A, B, C#, D, E, F#, G#, A

Frets on the E string: 5, 7, 9, 10, 12, 14, 16, 17

Pattern (intervals between notes): root, +2, +2, +1, +2, +2, +2, +1</blockquote>


<p>In music theory terms, the +1 difference is called a &ldquo;half-tone&rdquo; difference and the +2 is termed a &ldquo;whole tone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If you play notes (mostly) from one scale, you are said to be in that key. For example, if you play notes (mostly) from the E scale, you&rsquo;re in the key of E (major is generally implied&mdash;minor must be stated).</p>

<p>From scales, we can derive chords. Chords are groups of notes. The basic chord is 3 notes: 1 (root), 3, 5 of the scale.</p>

<p>An A minor chord contains the notes A, C, E (1, 3, 5 of the A minor scale).</p>

<p>The C major chord contains C, E, G (1, 3, 5 of the C major scale).</p>

<p>And the A major chord contains A, C#, E (1, 3, 5 of the A major scale).</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s a quick, high-level overview of the basis of all music. Now, rock on! \m/</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for more information, there are some great resources online. One that is nicely chunked is <a href="http://www.musictheory.net/lessons">http://www.musictheory.net/lessons</a></p>

      <p>IEEE, with slogans and taglines like &ldquo;The world&rsquo;s largest professional association for the advancement of technology&rdquo; and &ldquo;Advancing Technology for Society&rdquo; has lost its credibility. After being a member for 10 years, I can say I&rsquo;ve seen no benefits. In fact, I&rsquo;ve only encountered frustration like spam email, randomly assigned usernames that are hard to remember, and strictly enforced password policies that are less secure than my standards&mdash;making passwords impossible to remember. The website is ugly and hard to use. Want benefits like access to webinars? Sorry, that will cost extra. Doing research and trying to access an IEEE publication? Sorry, that will cost extra.</p>

<p>This came to a head recently when I checked the mail and saw an official looking envelope claiming membership information was included. This concerned me some, so I opened the envelope and found yet another junk mailing. No credible brand will allow spamvertising, much less spamvertising with their name all over it.</p>

<p>Sadly, IEEE promotes these services as an incentive to join. If these services are for my benefit, let me choose when to enact these benefits. <strong>IEEE is a cheap brand that sells its members&#8217; information</strong>. Their only claim to fame is convincing 400,000 people that their dues are low enough to endure. IEEE has lost its credibility: their information is late and incomplete&mdash;even worse, they charge inordinate amounts for research that might be timely and detailed.</p>

<p>There are so many worthwhile publications, blogs, and organizations; IEEE is not one of them. I will not be renewing my membership again. Will you? If so, why?</p>

      <p>I heard &ldquo;Dream on&rdquo; by Christian Falk featuring Robyn on <a title="Seth Holloway: looking for new music? check out the pitchfork 500" href="http://sethholloway.com/blog/2010/08/25/looking-for-new-music-or-old-favorites-check-the-pitchfork-500/">Pitchfork 500</a>, and I think it&rsquo;s a beautiful sonic experience&mdash;very poppy! makes me want to move&mdash;but listening to the lyrics makes me wonder, &ldquo;how is this a pop song?&rdquo; A sample:</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span style="font-family: Consolas, Monaco, 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px; white-space: pre;">You won&rsquo;t be sad or broken tonight</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: Consolas, Monaco, 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px; white-space: pre;">you won&rsquo;t be squealed on, ripped off tonight</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: Consolas, Monaco, 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px; white-space: pre;">you won&rsquo;t be back-stabbed, double crossed, face down</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: Consolas, Monaco, 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px; white-space: pre;">teeth knocked out, lying in a gutter somewhere</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: Consolas, Monaco, 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px; white-space: pre;">So dream on&#8221;</span></p>

<p>Hahaha, I love it! I can&rsquo;t think of another song with such (openly) dark content that is so accessible to the masses (pop). The Eagles might have been singing about a brothel, but you could easily think it was just a nice hotel in the middle of nowhere!</p>

      <p>When I was about 13 years old, I tried out for a local basketball league. Everyone who wanted to play showed up at a school gym and ran the same route while coaches looked on. We were given the ball at the free throw line; we were then supposed to shoot a free throw, grab the rebound and take off down the court. At the other end we were supposed to shoot a lay-up, rebound, then dribble back.</p>

<p>I missed every shot. In front of hundreds of kids and their hover-parents. How embarrassing.</p>

<p>I thought a lot about how to end this post and couldn&rsquo;t decide on one, so I&rsquo;ll make it a choose your own adventure.</p>

<p>(1) Don&rsquo;t judge a book by its cover! I was awesome! The tryouts were just that: tryouts. Like Allen Iverson said (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGDBR2L5kzI">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGDBR2L5kzI</a>), &ldquo;We talkin&#8217; &lsquo;bout practice, not the game&hellip;&rdquo; Not really :) The truth is, I was not much better than tryouts showed.</p>

<p>(2) Embarrassment is a part of life. &ldquo;That which does not kill us only makes us stronger.&rdquo; You can&rsquo;t live your life worried about what people think, so laugh about it and move on!</p>

<p>(3) That&rsquo;s when I found my niche and switched to computers. I knew I was good with computers, yet I was obviously not good at basketball. It was logical to do more of the things I was good at. While not entirely true, that is how life unfolded.</p>

<p>(4) Social currency! Everything we do makes us more interesting. I think this makes for a pretty funny story, and, no, it&rsquo;s not my most embarrassing moment.</p>

      <p>Blind and visually impaired people will never use the Internet like sighted people. It&rsquo;s not fair, but it&rsquo;s true. If it makes you feel better, visually impaired people have text read to them at 400+ words per minute (about three times faster than the rest of us). Making the web accessible is not easy, nor does it seem economically feasible when only 2.6% of the population is effected (that&rsquo;s <a title="Wikipedia: Blindness:Epidemiology" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blindness#Epidemiology" target="_blank">161 million people worldwide</a>). For those unconvinced that hundreds of extra hours of development and testing is worthwhile, consider the true economic value: search engine optimization (SEO). It turns out that simple accessibility changes also lead to higher PageRank, probably because web crawlers are blind. So dress up your images, links, and videos: you&rsquo;ll make your site easier to find and easier to read.</p>

      <p>People complain a lot about being under-appreciated. I think this is because good people do not necessarily stand out. It is often true that the squeaky wheel gets the grease. After some pondering, I believe that it is actually the people that require the least thought from a boss that are the best workers. The best compliment you can give someone is then that you don&rsquo;t have to worry about them. They allow your mind to be free so you can pursue more important or pleasurable thoughts. Take a moment to think about the people that you don&rsquo;t have to think about&mdash;the friend you can call anytime, the customer that always pays on time, the boss that stays out of your hair&mdash;now, thank them.</p>

      <p>TL;DR: check CustomUrl and SitesMappings.</p>

<p>Andrea is hosting her domain, <a title="Andrea Mire Holloway" href="http://www.andreamholloway.com/">andreamholloway.com</a>, on Google Sites. This is yet another great (free) service from Google; however, as with all Google products, you have to find your own way around. For weeks her site was only accessible via the funky, internal Google Sites address (<a href="https://sites.google.com/a/andreamholloway.com/www/">https://sites.google.com/a/andreamholloway.com/www/</a>)&mdash;hardly the address you want to share.</p>

<p>We googled for all kinds of keywords with no success. I believe this is a language problem at the core and the problem is particularly difficult because of jargon like DNS, CNAME, ANAME, route, address, URL, site, etc.</p>

<p>In the end, Google has made the process pretty simple. I believe you should only need to check three things</p>

<p>1. Ensure that you are not routing your site administrator/user access to www.&lt;your_domain&gt;
<a href="https://www.google.com/a/cpanel/YOUR_DOMAIN/CustomUrl" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.google.com/a/cpanel/YOUR_DOMAIN/CustomUrl">https://www.google.com/a/cpanel/YOUR_DOMAIN/CustomUrl</a></a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.google.com/a/cpanel/YOUR_DOMAIN/CustomUrl" target="_blank"></a>Leave your CustomUrl as the default (something like <a href="https://www.google.com/a/cpanel/yourdomain.com/">https://www.google.com/a/cpanel/yourdomain.com/</a>)</p>

<p>In this case &lt;your_domain&gt; is the domain you bought.</p>

<ol>
<li>In your SitesMappings, map your Google Site to www.yourdomain.com</li>
</ol>


<p><a href="https://www.google.com/a/cpanel/YOUR_DOMAIN/SitesMappings" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.google.com/a/cpanel/YOUR_DOMAIN/SitesMappings">https://www.google.com/a/cpanel/YOUR_DOMAIN/SitesMappings</a></a>
Add a new web address
Site Location<em>
[www]
Web Address</em>
[www]
Click &ldquo;Add mapping&rdquo; button</p>

<p>3. Map the naked domain (yourdomain.com without the www preceding) to www.yourdomain.com</p>

<p>If you did not purchase your domain through Google Sites, you may need to adjust the DNS settings. You&rsquo;ll need to Google around for the right settings, but you will see a lot of ghs.google.com.</p>

<p>For more, I&rsquo;d recommend you checkout Steegle&rsquo;s guide available <a title="Steegle's Google Sites How-to" href="http://www.steegle.com/websites/google-sites-howtos/googlesites-frequentlyaskedquestionsfaq">here</a>.</p>

<p>I hope this information helps others&mdash;I know I spent too much time trying to figure it out myself.</p>

      <p>The United States provides <a title="US Census aid numbers" href="http://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/cats/foreign_commerce_aid/foreign_aid.html" target="_blank">billions of dollars of aid to foreign nations every year</a>. It is questionable whether or not the aid is truly helping the people and if recipients are grateful for the assistance. For example, <a title="Why U.S. Farm Subsidies Are Bad for the World" href="http://www.commondreams.org/views02/0506-09.htm">some say</a> that giving food to agricultural nations actually reduces their ability to make money and improve themselves.</p>

<p>Rather than debate the current structure, why don&rsquo;t we use that money to fund trips abroad? American teens could have a federally funded <a title="Wikipedia: Gap Year" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gap_year">gap year</a>. As these travelers spend, they generate new jobs and bring up the people in the nations they visit. They might also gain some perspective and change the attitude that we&rsquo;re Ugly Americans.</p>

<p>What do you think, best idea ever? :)</p>

<p>For a glimpse at one can happen when you distribute food to hungry people check out the <a title="Anthony Bourdain No Reservations 10m in" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6gmB-jYd-c#at=600">No Reservations Haiti episode (10 minutes in)</a>.</p>

      <p>Preface: I&rsquo;m not hurt and the situation is now resolved. Earlier this semester I was hit by a car while riding my bike home, and it sucked.</p>

<p>I stopped at a four-way stop that&rsquo;s less than half a mile from my house. I look around before proceeding and all I see is a car maybe one hundred feet down the street to my right&mdash;plenty of time to stop. So I scoot through the intersection and as I&rsquo;m almost out I notice something peculiar out of the corner of my eye: the car is not stopping. I instinctively picked up my feet and then felt my bike jerk violently. My feet slammed down on the pavement and I was stunned.</p>

<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-1150" title="Back Tire After Getting Hit" src="/images/bike-wreck.jpg" alt="Back Tire After Getting Hit" width="300" height="224" /></p>

<p>A couple other cars went through the intersection and the guy that hit me kept rolling. I dropped my bike and pulled out my phone so I could call 911 and snap a picture of the perp. Just then he stopped. I ran over with no clear purpose, then thought better of it and stopped to call my wife and the police. The guy comes over and apologizes, but I wasn&rsquo;t having any of it. When the cop arrived the driver was ticketed and we exchanged information. From there, <a title="Progressive Insurance" href="http://www.progressive.com/">Progressive</a> and the <a title="The Peddler Bike shop" href="http://www.peddlerbike.com/">Peddler</a> got me sorted out.</p>

<p>Getting hit by a car sucks, but virtually every biker I talked to about it had a similar war story. It&rsquo;s a shame. Be safe out there cyclists!</p>
