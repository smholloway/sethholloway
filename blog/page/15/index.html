      <h1 class="link"><a href="/wheres-the-innovation-in-elevators/">Where&#8217;s the innovation in elevators?</a></h1>
      <p>I have to preface this by admitting that I live in <a title="Wikipedia: Tallest Buildings in Austin" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tallest_buildings_in_Austin">a short city</a>. Our skyscrapers now pass 50 stories, but for a long time we were around 30 stories and those buildings were rare. I cannot recall a time I rode an elevator above eight stories in Austin, so I&rsquo;m not an elevator expert. With that in mind, I have to wonder where is the innovation in elevators? I rode an express elevator in Chicago that only stopped at the top floor or bottom floor. That&rsquo;s a start, but what about the other 90 floors?</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a <a title="Vertical Transportation Handbook on Google" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=GLZdcTVI4kIC&amp;lpg=PA102&amp;ots=fsVe2fbXaN&amp;dq=elevators%20stop%20odd%20numbers&amp;pg=PA102#v=onepage&amp;q=elevators%20stop%20odd%20numbers&amp;f=false">Vertical Transportation Handbook</a> that details the theory behind elevators and optimum stop values, but I couldn&rsquo;t find anything as innovative as <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9Ig19gYP9o" target="_blank">the train that never stops</a>.</p>

<p>The train that never stops could probably be adapted to vertical transportation, but I&rsquo;m not excited about beta testing that one :)</p>

<p>We could borrow ideas from public transportation and have long-haul elevators that stop infrequently (like a train) then people move to a secondary elevator for shorter rides (like a bus). For example, let&rsquo;s say you want to get to the 19th floor. You&rsquo;d hop in the elevator, press [your desired floor/10] 2 then zip up to the 20th floor. From there you walk down a flight of stairs or take an elevator that only goes from 15 to 25.</p>

<p>Another idea is to stop at half floors. Want to go to 20? Get off at 19.5 and walk up a ramp (ADA compliant, woot!). This would eliminate half the stops without sacrificing convenience. This is more convenient than schemes that stop at only odd or even number floors.</p>

<p>How about elevators that open on multiple sides? You could then put elevators in the middle of a building and let people exit, for example, to the east or west.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d love to have slides and fireman poles for quick descents, but that doesn&rsquo;t solve the ascent issue&hellip;</p>

<p>So, what am I missing? Are there better ideas out there? How are people <a href="http://ph.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20100326094348AAVnkXO" target="_blank">traversing vertical cities these days</a>?</p>

      <p>.svnignore is my attempt to create the equivalent of .gitignore. After creating the file I had to set the svn:ignore property before it worked:
<code>svn propset svn:ignore -F .svnignore .</code></p>

<p>First, a little background: my PhD work uses <a title="Sun SPOT World" href="http://www.sunspotworld.com/">Sun (Oracle) SPOT devices</a> that run the <a title="Squawk VM" href="http://www.research.sun.com/projects/squawk/index.html">Java Squawk VM</a> (kinda like <a title="Wikipedia: Java Micro Edition" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Platform,_Micro_Edition">Java ME</a>). For version control, we use <a title="Subversion" href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a>. In keeping with good version control practices, I want to avoid putting binary and compiled files into version control. The easiest way to do this is a solid .svnignore file. I spent a few minutes trying to find a .svnignore example for Java and could not find anything, so I built one myself based on several examples I saw.</p>

<p>.svnignore</p>

<blockquote>
    *.class
    build/*
    j2meclasses/*
    .classpath
    .project
    .settings
    *.war
    *~
    *.lock
    *.DS_Store
    *.swp
    *.out
    *.bak
    *.tmp
    *.log
    log*.txt
    .idea
    .git
</blockquote>


<p>From the top, ignore class files, the build directory, the classes directory, our local classpath/project/settings, the compiled deployment package (WAR/JAR), any tilde backup files, a OS X specific directory,  VI files that are being edited, log files, backup and temporary files, IDE files (thanks <a title="Lane Holloway is awesome" href="http://www.laneholloway.com/">Lane</a>), and finally any git files (this part could be expanded to include other version control systems like Bazaar or Mercurial).</p>

<p>If I missed something, please let me know.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>GitHub has published a list of .gitignore files for a number of languages: <a title="GitHub's gitignore files" href="https://github.com/github/gitignore"><a href="https://github.com/github/gitignore">https://github.com/github/gitignore</a></a>. You can pop these into your .svnignore and apply the properties.</p>

      <p>Yesterday I heard a commercial for Time Warner Cable. They were advertising their cable/Internet bundles and named a price only to add a caveat that this price was for new subscribers only. This comes after I get a letter detailing Time Warner&rsquo;s impending price hike. It would feel great to exclaim, &ldquo;I like Time Warner! They&rsquo;ve treated me right and kept my rates fair.&rdquo; Instead, I say, &ldquo;I chose Time Warner because I don&rsquo;t have any other real options and their introductory rate was competitive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This is just one example. We&rsquo;ve created a culture of &ldquo;abandon ship&rdquo; instead of long-term brand relationships. Why don&rsquo;t companies use loyalty rates instead of special introductory pricing? Now, as I  look for new service providers, I am wooed by long-term savings rather than asterisk riddled short-term deals.</p>

<p>I sense that the pendulum is swinging and companies with outstanding customer support will prosper. As that happens, I hope consumers are rewarded for picking a company and sticking with them. Props to insurance and car companies for being some of the first to adopt this model.</p>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/idea-configurable-user-interfaces-in-cars/">Idea: Configurable User Interfaces in Cars</a></h1>
      <p>People spend a lot of time in their cars and we currently have to adapt to the car rather than have the car adapt to us. Why don&rsquo;t cars move to configurable heads up displays? When I drive, I have to move my focus from the road to the speedometer, mirrors, and fuel gauge. This information could be made more usable, which would increase safety and improve the user experience.</p>

<p>Gamers are comfortable with heads up displays. The user interface has data that players are used to seeing. For a first person shooter (FPS), for example, you will see health, a map, the weapon and armor left. In a sports game, you see the score, the time remaining, etc. Modern games allow users to configure the interface as they choose and people eat it up. Browsers are now doing similar things with addons/extensions. If you don&rsquo;t like the look and feel of the places where you spend time, you can change them. Cars should do the same.</p>

<p>In my case, I&rsquo;d like a digital speedometer and compass superimposed  in my field of view. I don&rsquo;t need to see fuel levels, temperatures, or anything else unless there&rsquo;s an error so blank those while driving. I&rsquo;d also love a mini-display of the cars around me. The car could use sensors to find other obstacles and provide a map&ndash;no more blind spot!</p>

<p>The only similar idea I&rsquo;ve heard of is factory customization for the Scion. You could choose any five of the thirty options (different wheels, floor mats, improved stereo, paint job, etc.). Where&rsquo;s the end-user programming for vehicles?</p>

<p>A simple roadmap to success: make all the gauges digital then allow users to configure how and where they are displayed.</p>

<p>Sound good? Would you buy a car that you could customize more? Isn&rsquo;t software great? :)</p>

      <p>Humans spend a lot of time in the bathroom. Not all the time is spent on bodily functions, but I think &ldquo;poddying&rdquo; is generally a waste of time&ndash;a human weakness! Is there any research on how to eliminate waste in the human body? For example, instead of creating urine you might be able burn up (metabolize) excess fluid. Urination expels waste, but sweat does too; that leads me to believe there are natural alternatives available (like a drug to route excess water to the skin instead of the bladder). Even solid wastes might be expelled in a more comfortable, scheduled way. If commercials are any indication, a large segment of the population regularly experiences discomfort associated with bodily functions, so this seems like a natural path for research: put people in control of their own body!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not a biologist and this is  not at all my field, so I&rsquo;d love to hear if I have missed any potential research or misunderstood the human machine.</p>

      <p>Ever woken up uncomfortably hot or cold? Maybe you wake up sweaty in the mornings? Why don&rsquo;t we embed intelligence into bedding to keep people at an ideal sleep temperature? Using thermometers, moisture sensors, and/or light sensors (wet skin reflects differently) you could easily determine an occupant&rsquo;s temperature and adjust accordingly. The adjustments are more tricky, I think. Perhaps you could raise the covers if people are too warm and tighten them if they&rsquo;re too cold; or have heating and cooling elements in the bed; or control airflow over the bed.</p>

<p>Does this exist? If not, why not?! Are there better ways to detect the person&rsquo;s temperature and adjust accordingly?</p>

      <p>Everyday, millions of people fly. I&rsquo;d guess most everyone hates the process. As with most things in life, happy people make everything better (they&rsquo;re more productive, etc)&ndash;and it&rsquo;s contagious!</p>

<p>Terminals</p>

<ul>
<li>Better seating</li>
<li>More A/C outlets</li>
<li>Free wifi</li>
<li>Smoking rooms</li>
</ul>


<p>Flights</p>

<ul>
<li>Allow people to use electronic devices the whole time</li>
<li>Turn on the entertainment system and A/C before passengers board and leave them on until people are off the plane</li>
<li>USB charging stations on each seat</li>
<li>Assigned overhead bins</li>
<li>Some sane amount of free alcohol (maybe 1 drink per 4 hours)</li>
<li>A light snack (research points to about 300 calories per 3 hours)</li>
<li>Treat people like adults!</li>
</ul>


<p>There are some other ideas in <a title="Salon" href="http://www.salon.com/technology/ask_the_pilot/2010/09/15/airplane_seating/index.html" target="_blank">this article on Salon</a>.</p>

<p>Beyond these, improved communication and more travel options would be fantastic. What would you like to see?</p>
