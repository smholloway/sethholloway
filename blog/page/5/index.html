      <p>In 2012 I discovered <a title="Rich Hickey on Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/richhickey">Rich Hickey</a> and he blew my mind. I think Hickey is one of the most important computer scientists of our time&ndash;we will see this in the next five to years. See his amazing presentations and creations like <a title="Are We There Yet presentation" href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Are-We-There-Yet-Rich-Hickey">Are We There Yet?</a>, <a title="Value of Values presentation" href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Value-Values">The Value of Values</a>, <a title="Simple Made Easy presentation" href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy">Simple Made Easy</a>, <a title="Clojure" href="http://clojure.org/">Clojure</a>, <a title="Datomic" href="http://www.datomic.com/">Datomic</a>, and <a href="http://www.infoq.com/author/Rich-Hickey">more</a>. Fueled by several great videos, I started learning Clojure. Here are my notes from the experience.</p>

<ul>
<li>I like that Clojure builds on Lisp. I feel like I&rsquo;m working on something cutting edge, yet proven. It feels like joining a dynasty, perhaps.</li>
<li>With Clojure, you write right to left, which is new and different. The prefix notation was not intuitive for me.</li>
</ul>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<ul>
<li><p>Map, Reduce, and Filter are really flexible. For example, reduce can be used to implement join really easily. Learning to think this way has not been immediate for me.</p>

<p> Clojure: (reduce #(str %1 &ldquo; &rdquo; %2) &lsquo;(&ldquo;the&rdquo;, &ldquo;quick&rdquo;, &ldquo;brown&rdquo;, &ldquo;fox&rdquo;, &ldquo;jumps&rdquo;, &ldquo;over&rdquo;, &ldquo;the&rdquo;, &ldquo;lazy&rdquo;, &ldquo;dog&rdquo;))
 JavaScript: [&ldquo;the&rdquo;, &ldquo;quick&rdquo;, &ldquo;brown&rdquo;, &ldquo;fox&rdquo;, &ldquo;jumps&rdquo;, &ldquo;over&rdquo;, &ldquo;the&rdquo;, &ldquo;lazy&rdquo;, &ldquo;dog&rdquo;].join(&ldquo; &rdquo;) == [&ldquo;the&rdquo;, &ldquo;quick&rdquo;, &ldquo;brown&rdquo;, &ldquo;fox&rdquo;, &ldquo;jumps&rdquo;, &ldquo;over&rdquo;, &ldquo;the&rdquo;, &ldquo;lazy&rdquo;, &ldquo;dog&rdquo;].reduce(function(a,b){return a + &ldquo; &rdquo; + b;})</p></li>
<li><p>Chaining functions together is fun.</p></li>
<li>2 + 4 is really applying the add function to two arguments (2 and 4). This seems like an obvious statement, but I normally think of the plus sign simply as an operator rather than a function. Clojure, Lisp really, wears new grooves in the brain.</li>
<li>It can be hard to get the iterative approach out of my head. For example, Project Euler problems to find the 2,000th prime feels like &ldquo;generate 2,000 primes and return the last one&rdquo; and to find the prime after 4,000,000 would be &ldquo;while the prime is less than 4 million, find the next prime.&rdquo; I had a hard time thinking of these functionally.</li>
<li>Lisp can be really clever and readable, and Clojure can be written almost the exact same way. Except that Lisp-style code in Clojure will blow the stack (due to the JVM&rsquo;s lack of ability to tail-call optimize) or perform like crap (the compiler needs &ldquo;hints&rdquo; to optimize performance). Suddenly, your beautiful recursive call turns into this less-readable loop-recur mess.</li>
<li>Following on the previous point, Lisp can be really unreadable. The language does not layer on any discipline, so the developers better do it. And it turns out that naming functions appropriately is really hard.</li>
<li>The standard library is really nice. It is lengthy, which makes it hard to learn.</li>
<li>There are a ton of great resources online. They can be woefully out-of-date.</li>
<li>In roughly 1 day, I was able to understand more code than I would have expected. I could not do much with that knowledge :)</li>
<li>I felt like I had to go to Clojure because it was not coming to me. I believe this reflects Rich Hickey&rsquo;s ethos: he created the language for a reason and wants you to use it in the intended way.</li>
<li>It was hard to convince my peers that Clojure was the language of the future. One of the most common questions was, &ldquo;are there any large system written in Clojure in production?&rdquo; Based on the reactions, I doubt Clojure will enter the mainstream anytime soon.</li>
</ul>


<p>Overall, I enjoyed learning Clojure and I feel it made me a better programmer. If you haven&rsquo;t checked it out, <a title="4clojure Problem 1" href="http://www.4clojure.com/problem/1">work through a few problems</a> and see what you think.</p>

      <p>Rewarding good behavior is really hard! Hard, but worthwhile.</p>

<p>Before I volunteered at an elementary school I had a vague idea about not rewarding troublemakers. Unfortunately, when I was in front of four classes of eager students, my ideas were tested. I called on the troublemakers, a lot.</p>

<p>This got me thinking about rewarding good behavior. If you have an unpleasant experience at a restaurant, you&rsquo;ll likely pay, leave, and never return. However, if you make a fuss, you can have your meal paid for by an apologetic manager. Almost universally it seems that a hissy-fit will get you everywhere. A friend of mine who worked in retail quipped that employees were instructed to accept any return for a full refund after the customer raised his voice. &ldquo;The squeaky wheel gets the grease.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As a reaction to my experience, I am trying to give credit when credit is due and to reward good behavior that I see around me. It feels strange to positively enforce a pleasant experience&ndash;it is much easier for me to complain about an unpleasant experience. Nothing good comes easy, eh?</p>

<p>How do <em>you</em> reward good behavior?</p>

      <p>Yet another post that never got published&hellip;</p>

<p>For my own memory as much as anything else, I thought I&rsquo;d list some of the highlights.</p>

<h2>Books</h2>


<p><strong>Cryptonomicon</strong> - Neal Stephenson: I conquered this book. Mike graciously presented me with this monster on my birthday last year. After a few months reading slowly, I read more seriously and knocked the book out quickly. Not as good as The Diamond Age, but I always love Stephenson.</p>

<p><strong>Twilight</strong> - Stephenie Meyers: I think I should be embarrassed that I finished it.</p>

<p><strong>Blood and Gold</strong> - Ann Rice: I&rsquo;m a fan of the Vampire Chronicles, but this book was a little too out there for me.</p>

<h2>Movies (in order of preference)</h2>


<p><strong>Sherlock Holmes</strong>: Just what I need! Another good action/adventure/mystery series. Really great cast (has Robert Downey Jr. done been in a bad movie since his recovery). I hope they make a lot of these!</p>

<p><strong>Avatar</strong>: Entertaining, yes; deep, no. Watch it in 3D and enjoy.</p>

<p><strong>Men Who Stare At Goats</strong>: I enjoyed the movie and laughed a lot. I&rsquo;m not sure it was supposed to be that comical, but I have a thing for &ldquo;the Dude, man&rdquo; (Jeff Bridges).</p>

<h2>TV Shows</h2>


<p><strong>30 Rock</strong>: Hilarious and wonderfully entertaining. This show turns me into that guy&ndash;yep, I laugh out loud sitting on the couch with my cat.</p>

<p><strong>Heroes</strong>: I&rsquo;ve now watched every episode (thanks Netflix!). Season 1 was fantastic! Season 2 and 3 were kinda good, however, Season 4 was a let down.</p>

<p><strong>Californication</strong>: I remember seeing the stories about David Duchovny being a sex addict in real life, which was ironic because that&rsquo;s what he plays in the show. Some said it was just a publicity stunt. I don&rsquo;t know either way, but he&rsquo;s awesome in the show about a vulnerable writer/father/ex struggling to do his best in life.</p>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/lord-british-helped-legitimize-kickstarter/">Lord British Helped Legitimize Kickstarter</a></h1>
      <p>I&rsquo;ve heard a lot of cynical complaints that <a title="Kickstarter" href="http://www.kickstarter.com/">Kickstarter</a> is being overrun by the big guys (as opposed to the little guys that &ldquo;Kickstarter was supposed to help&rdquo;). This is nonsense.</p>

<p>In my younger years I was a huge <a title="Wikipedia: Ultima Online" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultima_Online">Ultima Online (UO)</a> fan, so I was excited when I saw <a title="Wikipedia: Lord British" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_British">Lord British</a> was making a new game, <a title="Shroud of the Avatar" href="https://www.shroudoftheavatar.com/">Shroud of the Avatar</a>. Lord British, a.k.a. <a title="Richard Garriott" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Garriott">Richard Garriott</a>, put the game up on Kickstarter (a crowdfunding platform where creators offer rewards for support). I gladly pledged for <a title="Kickstarter: Shrine of the Avatar" href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/portalarium/shroud-of-the-avatar-forsaken-virtues-0">Shroud of the Avatar: Forsaken Virtues</a>.</p>

<p>Kickstarter is a great way to find out what people want! Would you have paid to back a <a title="Robot Chicken with JarJar" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdS2kCUGvfo">Star Wars with JarJar Binks</a>? Would you have pledged for <a title="Worst Games Ever: E.T." href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DTjLG3usQo">E.T. on the Atari</a>? How about <a title="Amazon: Microwave Cooking for One" href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1852250437/">Microwave Cooking for One</a>? Kickstarter can help people fail fast and find their target market then give the people what they want.</p>

<p>Luckily, we all benefit because Kickstarter is a platform. By using Kickstarter, Shroud of the Avatar did not take money from other projects&ndash;it proved a new idea and got people excited. The more people supporting projects on Kickstarter, the better off the community is. Because I&rsquo;m now familiar with the site, I am more likely to pledge again in the future&ndash;the only barrier is me pressing the &ldquo;Back This Project&rdquo; button.</p>

<p>Shroud of the Avatar probably could have been funded outside Kickstarter, but we should be glad that another project succeeded and more people now know about an amazing platform. I look forward to countless successes to come.</p>

      <p>For years I maintained Internet anonymity. However, that ended whenever I decided to purchase www.sethholloway.com. The domain establishes the true Seth Holloway ;-) I get to do some web programming, store files, and provide a little information about myself at the same time.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s strange that people can search &ldquo;Seth Holloway&rdquo; and find my site which leads them to my blog. &ldquo;How will my posts affect people&rsquo;s perception of me?&rdquo; I wonder. I&rsquo;ve asked some of my extremely intelligent peers for their take and gotten a variety of answers. Some say that you should censor your posts so there is nothing that would harm your future. However, short of illegal activities, what should we have to censor? Perhaps the best thing that humans could do is to know themselves and expose their opinions.</p>

<p>As <a title="Seth Godin's blog" href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2008/11/death-of-the-pe.html">Seth Godin says</a>, &ldquo;The point is not to show up on a list, the point is to start a conversation that spreads, to share ideas and to chronicle your thinking. That&rsquo;s the work of an author&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Maybe one day I&rsquo;ll expose my life using social media! :)</p>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/worldwide-food-crisis/">Worldwide food crisis</a></h1>
      <p>Food prices worldwide are rising. People are starving. People are protesting. With no end in sight, this issue seems incredibly important. A slew of journalists are discussing the complex issue involving food, fuel, natural disasters, politics, and more. Luckily, I have not been hit hard by rising food costs, but I know that others have been. A story on <a href="http://www.npr.org/" target="_blank">NPR</a>  inspired my post.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/15/business/worldbusiness/15food.html?ei=5065&amp;en=9e715f242c497f48&amp;ex=1208923200&amp;partner=MYWAY&amp;pagewanted=print" target="_blank">This article in the New York Times</a> discusses the link between biofuels and rising food prices worldwide. The article is full of facts and quotes, but it does not accurately consider the larger issues. For more insight, I cite <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-rice13-2008may13,0,3507989.story" target="_blank">this article in the L.A. Times</a>, which discusses the United States&#8217; role in Haitian food riots.</p>

<p>For years industrialized nations have been &ldquo;helping&rdquo; poor nations survive by providing food. Sadly, developing nations have (almost) by definition, agricultural economies meaning one of the few goods a developing nation can provide is food. Foreign aid artificially increases supply so that the working poor cannot hawk their wares.</p>

<p>There are numerous countries that survive on agriculture, so why don&rsquo;t they step up and make some money on the high demand and low supply?</p>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/the-pursuit-of-perfection/">The pursuit of perfection</a></h1>
      <p>In grad school I met a lot of really impressive people, which forced to ponder the pursuit of perfection. This was particularly true after observing several interviews with faculty candidates. Based on its statue, UT attracts a ton of high-quality wannabe professors. Of the 600+ applicants for each tenure-track position, only the top three get an interview; these select few are the rock stars of their field. With resumes that put the average person to shame, these individuals are nearing perfection, at least by academic standards.</p>

<p>One interview left me feeling uneasy. A candidate was extremely polished, having confidence backed with a cliched answer for every question. After our conversation the individual left me feeling like I had read a tutorial on success rather than interacted with a full, sentient being. For a week I have struggled to put my finger on why the insincerity bothered me so much. I understood that I had not spoken to a &ldquo;real&rdquo; person, whether the individual was unreal (some people are just <em>that </em>good) or simply lied, I cannot say. What I can say, however, is that an educator&rsquo;s role is to teach. One cannot teach a subject that they have not learned and learning necessitates progression, not perfection. Such extreme perfection, as displayed by the candidate, means that an individual has never struggled so they have never learned. How can you teach a student something that always made sense to you?</p>

<p>A poor analogy: We do not ask a person with <a title="Description of 20/20 vision" href="http://www.howstuffworks.com/question126.htm" target="_blank">20/20 vision</a> how to have good eyesight; instead, we ask the person with 20/200 vision how they got to 20/20. In my opinion, this is very similar to the millionaire playboy who was born on third base and thinks he hit a triple&ndash;few people can respect his opinion or take him seriously if he speaks about success.</p>

<p>The experience has improved my understanding of the value of context and stories in interviews. To err is human; what you do after the error defines your character.</p>

<p>The net effect: pursue perfection or stay perfect, but remember where you came from. Present your accomplishments humbly, in context of where you started and where you are now.</p>

<p>From <a title="YouTube: Truth about Supplements" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mfQTiumsO4" target="_blank">YouTube</a></p>

<p>The story makes an excellent point: supplements are not regulated and often hide behind a veil of proprietary secrecy. This is true for vitamins as well.</p>

      <p>Stop bragging about how much you shipped!</p>

<p>I understand that code does not generate revenue unless people are using it. I appreciate getting product out the door. I also love clean code a solid architecture that reduces maintenance costs and allows developers to stay productive for years to come. I cannot abide the &ldquo;ship or die&rdquo; mentality when people ship hacky, unusable software then play the &ldquo;shipping is everything&rdquo; card.</p>

<p>Not all shipping is a success. <a title="Wikipedia: Chinese milk scandal" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_Chinese_milk_scandal">China shipped melamine-laced milk</a> that made a ton of people sick. <a title="Wikipedia: Madoff Investment Scandal" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madoff_investment_scandal">Madoff shipped a lot of information</a> that led to financial ruin. <a title="NPR: Komen and Planned Parenthood" href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2012/01/31/146177902/furor-erupts-over-susan-g-komen-halt-of-grants-to-planned-parenthood">Komen shipped their plan to cut funding to Planned Parenthood</a> and faced a great backlash. <a title="Wikipedia: Mars Climate Orbiter" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Climate_Orbiter">NASA shipped code with metric-imperial unit mismatch</a> and crashed a $300,000,000 rover. <a title="Wikipedia: Microsoft Clippy" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_Assistant">Microsoft shipped Clippy</a> and people cringed. A little oversight before shipping can save lives and prevent PR nightmares.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s stop glorifying shipping and start glorifying quality, happiness (for clients and employees), and success.</p>

      <p>I&rsquo;m not sure if it&rsquo;s the economy or just bad luck, but my customer service experiences recently have been awful. Customer service reps have frustrated me and wasted my time without ever leaving me pleased. Based on my experiences I have extrapolated the modern customer service handbook:</p>

<pre><code>Customer Service State of the Practice (All Wrong)

Client-facing representatives should:

1) Start by telling a customer "no"

2) If the customer persists, ice them for some time (10 minutes should suffice) then return and say "no" again

3) If the customer is still around, pass the buck

4) There is no step 4 because customers do not have the time and energy to get through to this level

If at any point the customer asks to speak to a manager,

1) "Accidentally" hang up or walk off and "forget" about the customer

2) Instead, route them to the wrong department

3) Tell them your boss is not available

If the customer gets to a manager, the manager should

1) Never allow the customer to reach their manager. Working excuses include "I am the manager on duty." "My boss is not available." "My boss is not available can I leave a message?" "You can only reach my manager via email."

2) Reply as slowly as possible

3) First tell the customer "no"

4) If they persist, look into possible solutions

Further compounding the frustration a phone system should:

1) Start with at least 15 seconds of unavoidable speech

2) Slowly offer the first options without preemption if the customer knows where to go (i.e. no pressing '1' early)

3) Consist of at least two menus

4) Terminate with a recorded message directing the customer elsewhere at least 50% of the time

If a website exists it should:

1) Be slow

2) Be confusing

3) Terminate in a message directing the customer to call customer service
</code></pre>

<p>I&rsquo;ve encountered this workflow twice in a few weeks and it is all wrong! If you want to succeed in business, do the exact opposite of this. Customer service should have one objective: pleasing customers. I understand this may cost more, but the funny thing about customers is that you want them and you won&rsquo;t get that when your representatives run all customers off.</p>

<p>Two of my favorite bloggers, <a title="Seth Godin" href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/" target="_blank">Seth Godin</a> and <a title="Joel On Software" href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/" target="_blank">Joel Spolsky</a>, have commented on the simple act of pleasing customers and the big impact it has. See <a title="Joel on Software: Excellent Customer Service" href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/customerservice.html" target="_blank">Joel&rsquo;s take on customer service</a> and <a title="Google search of Seth Godin's site" href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;domains=http%3A%2F%2Fsethgodin.typepad.com%2F&amp;sitesearch=http%3A%2F%2Fsethgodin.typepad.com%2F&amp;q=customer+service+site%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fsethgodin.typepad.com%2F&amp;btnG=Search&amp;sitesearch=http%3A%2F%2Fsethgodin.typepad.com%2F" target="_blank">Seth&rsquo;s many posts</a>, especially <a title="Seth Godin Apologies Ranked" href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2007/02/apologies_ranke.html" target="_blank">apologies and what they mean</a> and the <a title="Seth Godin Creating a Clearance Culture" href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2008/11/creating-a-clea.html" target="_blank">clearance culture</a>.</p>

<p>My desperate plea to employers is really quite simple:</p>

<ul>
<li>Empower entry level customer service representatives to solve problems&ndash;they are the ones making an impression</li>
<li>Give customer service representatives respect&ndash;they drive as many sales as the marketing department</li>
<li>Pay customer service representatives fairly&ndash;this may require hiring people of a worthy caliber</li>
<li>Offer customer service representatives a career path&ndash;again, you may have to be awake while hiring</li>
<li>Reduce the overhead in communications&ndash;reduce wait times, shorten telephone spiels, etc.</li>
<li>Go out of your way to thank and appreciate customers&ndash;your business does not exist without them!</li>
</ul>
