      <p>I recently got accepted to the <a title="Clicker.com" href="http://www.clicker.com/" target="_blank">Clicker.com</a> beta. Clicker is a promising way to watch TV online, through a single portal. In their words:</p>

<blockquote>
<h3>What is Clicker?</h3>
Clicker is the complete guide to Internet Television. Our mission is to make it simple for you to find the right show, right now.

As massive amounts of programming move online, consumers entering a world of infinite choices, all on-demand. Great! Finding the show you want to watch? Painful. Thousands of episodes from thousands of shows are housed on thousands of different sites, mixed among billions of random clips and videos.

Clicker catalogs all broadcast programming online, along with TV-quality Web originals, from these silos and delivers them in one seamless, organized experience so you can easily discover what&#8217;s available to watch (and what isn&#8217;t) online, where to watch it, and what&#8217;s worth watching.</blockquote>


<p>I&rsquo;m lucky enough to have five invitations to share, so if you&rsquo;re interested follow the link and sign up: <a title="Clicker Invites: First come, first served" href="http://www.clicker.com/invite/Z4LwmGGNN71Cp8OO0QKw7w" target="_blank"> <a href="http://www.clicker.com/invite/Z4LwmGGNN71Cp8OO0QKw7w">http://www.clicker.com/invite/Z4LwmGGNN71Cp8OO0QKw7w</a></a> (first come, first served)</p>

      <p>After I started riding my bike more often, I got interested in bike culture. I&rsquo;ve talked to seasoned UT cyclists learning best routes, safety tips, how to maintain a bike, how to stay warm/cool, etc. One of my favorite topics has been the fixie. The fixie, or <a title="Wikipedia: Fixed-gear Bicycle" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-gear_bicycle" target="_blank">fixed-gear bicycle</a> is something of an anomaly. Fixies do not have &ldquo;speeds&rdquo; like the ubiquitous childhood 10-speed; instead, fixies are single-speed bikes that directly tie pedal rotations to tire rotations. If your tires are moving, so are your pedals. So much for coasting!  Most fixies do not have brakes&mdash;not even <a title="Wikipedia: Coaster Brakes" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle_brake_systems#Coaster_brakes" target="_blank">coaster brakes</a> like your old BMX bike! A fixie rider has to stop the bike by resisting the pedals. By avoiding modern technology, fixies are the black sheep of bikes.</p>

<p>Below is a picture of a typical fixie. There are a few things to notice</p>

<ul>
<li>the lack of gears and a tight chain</li>
<li>the colored wheels</li>
<li>the thin, custom handlebars</li>
<li>somewhat flashy, although aesthetically pleasing</li>
</ul>


<p><a href="http://www.tonicfab.com/uploaded_images/blk_fixie_7-794097.jpg"><img title="A typical fixie" src="http://www.tonicfab.com/uploaded_images/blk_fixie_7-794097.jpg" alt="A typical fixie" width="400" height="346" /></a></p>

<p>Please see Wired&rsquo;s article on five <a title="Wired.com: 5 inexplicable fixie trends" href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2009/04/five-inexplicab/" target="_blank">inexplicable fixie trends</a> for more ways to identify a fixie.</p>

<p>Fixies seems to have risen to prominence in New York City where crazy bicycle messengers would deftly maneuver through traffic en route to deliveries. Other big cities followed suit and a cult of cool was spawned: if you didn&rsquo;t ride a fixie, you weren&rsquo;t hardcore.</p>

<p>Fixed-gear cycling is said to be the most intense experience one can have with the road, and the bicycle is incredibly easy to maintain because it is so simple. Opponents point out that this style of riding is hard on the body, particularly the knees, and generally dumb because 1) brakes are incredibly useful, especially in the city, and 2) gears are incredibly useful, especially in a hilly city where speed and effort need to be modulated quickly.</p>

<p>You see quite a few fixies in Austin, generally ridden by hipsters. I&rsquo;ll unscientifically say they&rsquo;re &frac14; bikes I see ridden (while the absolute number of fixed-gear bicycles is small, fixie riders use their bikes a lot so you see more of them as a percentage). Originally, I thought the fixed-gear bicycle was just a fad, but the ridership is still strong.</p>

<p>In case you&rsquo;re wondering why anyone would ever ride a fixie, here are a few videos that demonstrate the true power of fixies (hint: none of these videos take place on <a title="6street.com: Guadalupe" href="http://www.6street.com/6s_pg_guadalupe.htm" target="_blank">the drag</a>):</p>

<p>Or the more graceful, feminine bicycle ballerinas: <a title="YouTube: Bicycle Ballerinas" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48C_KHwt53c" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48C_KHwt53c">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48C_KHwt53c</a></a> and the bicycle ballerina: <a title="YouTube.com: Bicycle Ballerina" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxV1X5EzfCA" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxV1X5EzfCA">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxV1X5EzfCA</a></a></p>

<p>What do you think? Would you ride a fixie? Do you already? Are they a good-for-nothing trend or the ultimate bike experience? Perhaps both?</p>

      <p>Chances are, you don&rsquo;t know if you have something in your teeth because no one will tell you. It&rsquo;s embarrassing. It&rsquo;s intimate. It&rsquo;s real.</p>

<p>If you do not have a friend who will tell you that you have something in your teeth, get one. If you will not return the courtesy to your good friends, change! Life is greatly enriched by deep social interactions.</p>

<p>Thanks to all my friends who treat me with respect, fairness, and honesty&mdash;my teeth would not be so clean without you all :)</p>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/public-transport-technology-good/">Public Transport + Technology = Good</a></h1>
      <p>Why don&rsquo;t public transportation providers outfit their vehicles with GPS trackers and update the position in real time? This would effectively eliminate the need for time tables: just check the website/phone application to see when a bus will be near you. Traffic? No problem! The map still shows exactly where the bus is. Even the bus-drivers could use the map to coordinate with other bus-drivers on their route.</p>

<p>Extending this system, the bus could text individuals whenever it is <em>X</em> minutes from a <em>bus-stop</em> (where the user sets the <em>X</em> and the <em>bus-stop</em>). I have a bus stop two minutes from my front door, so the morning bus would text me when it was five minutes away; similarly, at school I&rsquo;m about 10 minutes from the bus stop so I would want a text about 15 minutes in advance. That&rsquo;s better living through software! And the technology exists already.</p>

<p>From an economics standpoint, this innovation would be justified if ridership would increase enough to offset the cost of the project (hardware, software, installation. and maintenance). My hunch is that this system would pay itself off quickly because more people would ride the bus if it were easier to catch. Who wants to wait in the rain or the sweltering heat indefinitely? A system like this would also differentiate the transportation operator and raise the bar on service. I rode a bullet train, in part, because I wanted to experience the future. I can just imagine Austinintes on vacation bragging, &ldquo;CapMetro back in Austin texts you whenever the bus is close! Why doesn&rsquo;t this city do the same?&rdquo;</p>

<p>So, how about it? Why doesn&rsquo;t your city make public transportation easier? What other innovations and upgrades should we expect from public transportation?</p>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/weekend-update/">Weekend Update</a></h1>
      <p>School has officially resumed! I am busy writing and rewriting my PhD research now as I prepare to propose in October. I wanted to make a quick post in the midst of it all.</p>

<p>First, thanks to everyone who participated in the smart home survey! We received tremendous support and high quality responses. Beyond that, I&rsquo;ll be continuing my support of <a title="Students in Software Engineering @ UT" href="http://www.edge.utexas.edu/sse/" target="_blank">Students in Software Engineering</a>, now led by the very awesome Justin Enderle.</p>

<p>As school starts back up, I return to listening to music almost constantly while on campus. <a title="Pandora Online Radio" href="http://www.pandora.com">Pandora</a> has imposed limits on playtime, but luckily other services are taking its place. I&rsquo;m relatively happy with <a title="Slacker Public Radio" href="http://www.slacker.com/" target="_blank">Slacker Personal Radio</a> after my Pandora playtime is up for the month. <a title="Last FM Internet Radio" href="http://www.last.fm" target="_blank">Last.fm</a> is another nice alternative, and I&rsquo;ve heard recommendations for <a title="I Heart Radio" href="http://www.iheartradio.com/national_radio_tuner/main.html" target="_blank">I Heart Radio</a> and <a title="Yahoo! Music" href="http://new.music.yahoo.com/" target="_blank">Yahoo! Music</a>, though the lack of customization deters me. Have you found a better service?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d like to share a great article on <a title="The Atlantic: Health Care" href="http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200909/health-care/" target="_blank">America&rsquo;s incorrect direction for health care reform</a>. Here&rsquo;s an excerpt:</p>

<blockquote>Incentives that emphasize health <em>care</em> over any other aspect of health and well-being. That emphasize treatment over prevention. That disguise true costs. That favor complexity, and discourage transparent competition based on price or quality. That result in a generational pyramid scheme rather than sustainable financing.</blockquote>


<p>I have not had time to write a decent post about this, so I&rsquo;ll just link an interesting read about <a title="Death Row Lunacy" href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2009-08-18/scalias-death-row-lunacy/" target="_blank">Supreme Court Justice Scalia and his blind allegiance to &ldquo;the law.&rdquo;</a> And a tasty nugget:</p>

<blockquote>“This court,” Scalia pointed out, “has never held that the Constitution forbids the execution of a convicted defendant who has had a full and fair trial but is later able to convince a court that he is ‘actually’ innocent.”</blockquote>


<p>Finally, I have to share a laugh with a <a title="YouTube: Best People's Court Ending Ever" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pbfs2lYM2sQ">video</a> that makes me laugh heartily.</p>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/software-engineering-genealogy/">Software Engineering Genealogy</a></h1>
      <p>I recently discovered the <a title="Software Engineering Genealogy" href="http://people.engr.ncsu.edu/txie/sefamily.htm" target="_blank">Software Engineering Academic Genealogy</a>. For those outside the ivory tower, this genealogy mirrors standard human breeding records. In the not-so-distant future I will be an indentation under <a title="Christine's awesomely outdated page :)" href="http://www.ece.utexas.edu/%7Ejulien/" target="_blank">Christine Julien</a>, below <a title="Gruia Catalin Roman" href="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/%7Eroman" target="_blank">Gruia-Catalin Roman</a>. Standard genealogical terms apply in the academic version as well; for example, Christine is my academic parent.</p>

<p>Just as in humans, breed history can be an important determination of future success. A descendant of a well-known researcher will have high expectations to perform like their academic ancestor, but this is also a great way to position oneself for the job one desires. For example, if you want to be a professor, ensure that your advisor has graduated other students who became faculty. Unfortunately, this way of thinking favors older professors and can make it hard for new faculty to establish themselves despite their fresh ideas and tenacity. As with humans, genealogy comes with no guarantees! Individuals create their own track records. An advisor&rsquo;s personality and research should play into the perspective student&rsquo;s decision. Find an <a title="Sensor Enablement for the Average Programmer" href="http://mpc.ece.utexas.edu/SEAP/" target="_blank">interesting topic</a> and do it well!</p>

<p>While we&rsquo;re on the subject, another fun genealogical term borrowed by scholars is &ldquo;<a title="Luis Von Ahn discusses his &quot;imbred&quot; hiring" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wXsQxZLEEc" target="_blank">academic imbreeding</a>&rdquo; or &ldquo;academic incest&rdquo; which refers to the taboo practice of hiring people from the host university.</p>

<p>And that concludes today&rsquo;s lecture. Visit me in my office hours if you have any questions. Have a nice weekend!</p>
