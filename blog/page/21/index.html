      <p>It&rsquo;s always exciting to read sci-fi novels and discover what the future could look like. Sci-fi movies show it even more vividly. Minority Report has a futuristic gesture-based user interface that looks cool, but I&rsquo;m not sure I would use it well :)</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of space between the Minority Report style and our current interfaces. Research will get us there one day, but in the meantime I would love a user interface where I could simultaneously view arbitrarily many modules (web pages, documents, games, etc.) or submodules (pieces of those things). Each (sub)module could be closed, moved, and resized: think ofÂ  iPhone-like controls on all your browser tabs. Windows Alt-Tab preview as well as browsers tab previews are a step in the right direction, but you ultimately choose only one module at a time. Mashups  (iGoogle for example) offered are a promising path to achieving this, but I still have not seen dynamically-sized, dynamically-loaded, swappable modules.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve got the technology, please let me know. If not, create it and send me a link to buy it!</p>

      <p>I&rsquo;m not sure if it&rsquo;s the economy or just bad luck, but my customer service experiences recently have been awful. Customer service should have pleasing customers as a general goal. I understand this may cost more, but the funny thing about customers is that you want them and you won&rsquo;t get that when your representatives run all customers off.</p>

<p>Two of my favorite bloggers, <a title="Seth Godin" href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/" target="_blank">Seth Godin</a> and <a title="Joel On Software" href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/" target="_blank">Joel Spolsky</a>, have commented on the simple act of pleasing customers and the big impact it has. See <a title="Joel on Software: Excellent Customer Service" href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/customerservice.html" target="_blank">Joel&rsquo;s take on customer service</a> and <a title="Google search of Seth Godin's site" href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;domains=http%3A%2F%2Fsethgodin.typepad.com%2F&amp;sitesearch=http%3A%2F%2Fsethgodin.typepad.com%2F&amp;q=customer+service+site%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fsethgodin.typepad.com%2F&amp;btnG=Search&amp;sitesearch=http%3A%2F%2Fsethgodin.typepad.com%2F" target="_blank">Seth&rsquo;s many posts</a>, especially <a title="Seth Godin Apologies Ranked" href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2007/02/apologies_ranke.html" target="_blank">apologies and what they mean</a> and the <a title="Seth Godin Creating a Clearance Culture" href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2008/11/creating-a-clea.html" target="_blank">clearance culture</a>.</p>

<p>My desperate plea to employers is really quite simple:</p>

<ul>
<li>Empower entry level customer service representatives to solve problems&ndash;they are the ones making an impression</li>
<li>Give customer service representatives  respect&ndash;they drive as many sales as the marketing department</li>
<li>Pay customer service representatives fairly&ndash;this may require hiring people of a worthy caliber</li>
<li>Offer customer service representatives a career path&ndash;again, you may have to be awake while hiring</li>
<li>Reduce the overhead in communications&ndash;reduce wait times, shorten telephone spiels, etc.</li>
<li>Go out of your way to thank and appreciate customers&ndash;your business does not exist without them!</li>
</ul>

      <p>As I perfect my PhD workflow I&rsquo;m learning a lot. I&rsquo;ve gotten much more efficient at finding related work and target conferences; I&rsquo;ve improved my writing and organizational skills; I&rsquo;ve found a number of tools that make my life easier (for example I use Google Docs to track references and write drafts so that I can view them from any Internet-connected computer). However, now I&rsquo;m at the point where I know my topic and I need to stay current on the research. From what I can tell, most academics do this by reading the program from conferences related to their work. That&rsquo;s fine as a backup, but there&rsquo;s got to be an easier way! Why not automate the delivery of related articles or entire conference proceedings?</p>

<p>As a dedicated RSS fan (RSS feeds are a great way to keep up with the latest news!) I would love to subscribe to my 10 conferences and have them publish to my reader as soon as the proceedings are available. However, IEEE and ACM do not publish papers or articles via RSS! I understand conferences are big money makers so you may want to make people pay for the content, but I get emails and magazines from IEEE that I could receive instead as an RSS feed. Groups that represent the height of technological research are 10 years behind the times!</p>

<p>Thanks to blogs, twitter, facebook, and the raft of immediate media, everyone is a publisher. IEEE and ACM seem to be following the print newspaper style which is not 1) economically feasible or 2) good for spreading your brand. Don&rsquo;t try to horde content in hopes of making more money. I get more interesting research from Wired than I do from IEEE because IEEE withholds the work. (That&rsquo;s hyperbole of course&ndash;my job is to cruise for papers and UT has an amazing infrastructure in place for doing so&ndash;however, Wired does make it much easier to find interesting technology).</p>

<p>Until I find another way, I plan on setting up Google alerts (sent to my RSS reader) to notify me of conference proceedings and/or make related work searches into RSS feeds (i.e. get a notification when a new rolling alarm clock is discussed). Does anyone else see the irony in all this? Has anyone found an easier way to stay up to date with research in your area?</p>

      <p>I came across a website that <a title="Obama CTO" href="http://obamacto.org/" target="_blank">tallies votes on technological ideas that the Obama CTO</a> will hopefully take to heart. I like the voting scheme employed; you&rsquo;re given 10 votes and you can give up to three votes per idea&ndash;kind of like the <a title="wikipedia Condorcet" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet_method" target="_blank">Condorcet voting method</a> <a title="seth holloway dot com comments" href="http://sethholloway.com/blog/?p=205" target="_blank">I learned about</a> during this presidential election.</p>

<p>I agreed with the top three choices (net neutrality, repeal the patriot act, and repeal the DMCA), so these received one vote each. I also put one point into restoring DARPA because I&rsquo;m a fan of futuristic research that may have no commercial impacts for years to come. I put three votes towards more research into energy and rethinking IP law because those are two of my biggest technological pet peeves.</p>

<p>The site has a lot of good ideas, although I would like to see more about security. All the money and technology in the world will be useless if we do not have control of our own machines. America has criminalized hacking rather than studying it; without knowledge of hacking, how can we stop it?</p>

<p>I would also like to see more push for improving technological infrastructure so that America can continue to compete in the future. We know the theory, but other nations are actually implementing these cool ideas.</p>

<p>In your opinion is the site missing any good ideas? Where did you put your 10 votes?</p>

<p>In a similar vein, the updated <a title="Software Engineering at UT" href="http://www.edge.utexas.edu/se/" target="_blank">Software Engineering website</a> is up. I think it looks clean while intuitively presenting all the useful information.</p>

<p>On a completely unrelated note&hellip; <a title="Rock Auto" href="https://www.rockauto.com/" target="_blank">Rock Auto part</a>s is an amazing online catalog of (believe it or not) auto parts. I was able to find a random knob for an affordable $6! If you need some parts, check it out.</p>

<p>Also, if you haven&rsquo;t seen this site before, <a title="123People" href="http://www.123people.com/" target="_blank">123 peopl</a>e aggregates online information about people. Apparently I have a web presence that I can be proud of. Do you?</p>

      <p>I feel like I should write about something more insightful because of the title, but instead I&rsquo;m linking (hence a <a title="10 body hacks" href="http://lifehacker.com/software/lifehacker-top-10/top-10-body-hacks-257746.php" target="_blank">link)</a> to 10 things you can learn to do with your body.

Reading <a title="10 body hacks" href="http://lifehacker.com/software/lifehacker-top-10/top-10-body-hacks-257746.php" target="_blank">this article</a> has given me insight into how to do <a title="Google answers on whistling" href="http://answers.google.com/answers/threadview?id=419588" target="_blank">the same</a>&ndash;and nine other tricks. Some are lame or ill-explained, but we take the good with the bad.</p>

<p>My grandpa and Jason can make their ears wiggle like jello on a washing machine! Unfortunately, that one was not covered in the article, so I may never know how to do it&hellip; I can flare my nostrils though! Go me!</p>

<p>On the serious side, now is a good time to learn a new skill and expand your network in order to improve your chances of being employed. As Mike told me, people should have two separate careers. I&rsquo;m a grad student and a maverick&ndash;I think my future is bright!</p>

      <p>The Economist has an <a title="Fallibility of scientific journals" href="http://www.economist.com/science/displayStory.cfm?story_id=12376658" target="_blank">interesting article</a> about the nature of scientific publications&ndash;namely that research is wrong. The author points out that overstating your research will increase the chances of it getting noticed and getting published. Scientific research has become big business: publish or perish! Two major points that I find to be true (unfortunately):</p>

<ul>
<li>Negative results are not publishable.</li>
<li>Big, bold claims are more likely to get published than incremental updates.</li>
</ul>


<p>The Internet has made <a title="Techdirt said it first" href="http://techdirt.com/articles/20080922/0331332329.shtml" target="_blank">everyone a publisher</a> so many traditional institutions need to be reformed. Research is not immune. The article suggests that, rather than trusting journals, all quality above some threshold be published.</p>

<p>Good points. Interesting solutions. Any dissenters out there?</p>
