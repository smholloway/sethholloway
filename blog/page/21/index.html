      <p>Why don&rsquo;t public transportation providers outfit their vehicles with GPS trackers and update the position in real time? This would effectively eliminate the need for time tables: just check the website/phone application to see when a bus will be near you. Traffic? No problem! The map still shows exactly where the bus is. Even the bus-drivers could use the map to coordinate with other bus-drivers on their route.</p>

<p>Extending this system, the bus could text individuals whenever it is <em>X</em> minutes from a <em>bus-stop</em> (where the user sets the <em>X</em> and the <em>bus-stop</em>). I have a bus stop two minutes from my front door, so the morning bus would text me when it was five minutes away; similarly, at school I&rsquo;m about 10 minutes from the bus stop so I would want a text about 15 minutes in advance. That&rsquo;s better living through software! And the technology exists already.</p>

<p>From an economics standpoint, this innovation would be justified if ridership would increase enough to offset the cost of the project (hardware, software, installation. and maintenance). My hunch is that this system would pay itself off quickly because more people would ride the bus if it were easier to catch. Who wants to wait in the rain or the sweltering heat indefinitely? A system like this would also differentiate the transportation operator and raise the bar on service. I rode a bullet train, in part, because I wanted to experience the future. I can just imagine Austinintes on vacation bragging, &ldquo;CapMetro back in Austin texts you whenever the bus is close! Why doesn&rsquo;t this city do the same?&rdquo;</p>

<p>So, how about it? Why doesn&rsquo;t your city make public transportation easier? What other innovations and upgrades should we expect from public transportation?</p>

      <p>School has officially resumed! I am busy writing and rewriting my PhD research now as I prepare to propose in October. I wanted to make a quick post in the midst of it all.</p>

<p>First, thanks to everyone who participated in the smart home survey! We received tremendous support and high quality responses. Beyond that, I&rsquo;ll be continuing my support of <a title="Students in Software Engineering @ UT" href="http://www.edge.utexas.edu/sse/" target="_blank">Students in Software Engineering</a>, now led by the very awesome Justin Enderle.</p>

<p>As school starts back up, I return to listening to music almost constantly while on campus. <a title="Pandora Online Radio" href="http://www.pandora.com">Pandora</a> has imposed limits on playtime, but luckily other services are taking its place. I&rsquo;m relatively happy with <a title="Slacker Public Radio" href="http://www.slacker.com/" target="_blank">Slacker Personal Radio</a> after my Pandora playtime is up for the month. <a title="Last FM Internet Radio" href="http://www.last.fm" target="_blank">Last.fm</a> is another nice alternative, and I&rsquo;ve heard recommendations for <a title="I Heart Radio" href="http://www.iheartradio.com/national_radio_tuner/main.html" target="_blank">I Heart Radio</a> and <a title="Yahoo! Music" href="http://new.music.yahoo.com/" target="_blank">Yahoo! Music</a>, though the lack of customization deters me. Have you found a better service?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d like to share a great article on <a title="The Atlantic: Health Care" href="http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200909/health-care/" target="_blank">America&rsquo;s incorrect direction for health care reform</a>. Here&rsquo;s an excerpt:</p>

<blockquote>Incentives that emphasize health <em>care</em> over any other aspect of health and well-being. That emphasize treatment over prevention. That disguise true costs. That favor complexity, and discourage transparent competition based on price or quality. That result in a generational pyramid scheme rather than sustainable financing.</blockquote>


<p>I have not had time to write a decent post about this, so I&rsquo;ll just link an interesting read about <a title="Death Row Lunacy" href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2009-08-18/scalias-death-row-lunacy/" target="_blank">Supreme Court Justice Scalia and his blind allegiance to &ldquo;the law.&rdquo;</a> And a tasty nugget:</p>

<blockquote>“This court,” Scalia pointed out, “has never held that the Constitution forbids the execution of a convicted defendant who has had a full and fair trial but is later able to convince a court that he is ‘actually’ innocent.”</blockquote>


<p>Finally, I have to share a laugh with a <a title="YouTube: Best People's Court Ending Ever" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pbfs2lYM2sQ">video</a> that makes me laugh heartily.</p>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/software-engineering-genealogy/">Software Engineering Genealogy</a></h1>
      <p>I recently discovered the <a title="Software Engineering Genealogy" href="http://people.engr.ncsu.edu/txie/sefamily.htm" target="_blank">Software Engineering Academic Genealogy</a>. For those outside the ivory tower, this genealogy mirrors standard human breeding records. In the not-so-distant future I will be an indentation under <a title="Christine's awesomely outdated page :)" href="http://www.ece.utexas.edu/%7Ejulien/" target="_blank">Christine Julien</a>, below <a title="Gruia Catalin Roman" href="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/%7Eroman" target="_blank">Gruia-Catalin Roman</a>. Standard genealogical terms apply in the academic version as well; for example, Christine is my academic parent.</p>

<p>Just as in humans, breed history can be an important determination of future success. A descendant of a well-known researcher will have high expectations to perform like their academic ancestor, but this is also a great way to position oneself for the job one desires. For example, if you want to be a professor, ensure that your advisor has graduated other students who became faculty. Unfortunately, this way of thinking favors older professors and can make it hard for new faculty to establish themselves despite their fresh ideas and tenacity. As with humans, genealogy comes with no guarantees! Individuals create their own track records. An advisor&rsquo;s personality and research should play into the perspective student&rsquo;s decision. Find an <a title="Sensor Enablement for the Average Programmer" href="http://mpc.ece.utexas.edu/SEAP/" target="_blank">interesting topic</a> and do it well!</p>

<p>While we&rsquo;re on the subject, another fun genealogical term borrowed by scholars is &ldquo;<a title="Luis Von Ahn discusses his &quot;imbred&quot; hiring" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wXsQxZLEEc" target="_blank">academic imbreeding</a>&rdquo; or &ldquo;academic incest&rdquo; which refers to the taboo practice of hiring people from the host university.</p>

<p>And that concludes today&rsquo;s lecture. Visit me in my office hours if you have any questions. Have a nice weekend!</p>

      <p>As I&rsquo;ve said <a title="Seth Holloway: World Religion Visual" href="http://sethholloway.com/blog/2009/07/12/world-relgions-visual/" target="_blank">before</a>, I&rsquo;m a sucker for effective visualizations. In this age of &ldquo;<a title="Wikipedia: American Energy Independence" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_energy_independence" target="_blank">energy independence</a>&rdquo; I was really taken aback by this visual: the energy generation, transmission, and consumption in the U.S. Given the complexity of the information and sheer volume of data to present, I think this visual does an excellent job. (Other interesting visuals are available on the Lawrence Livermore site <a title="Energy at Lawrence Livermore" href="https://eed.llnl.gov/flow/" target="_blank">here</a>. Thanks to <a title="Drew Stovall" href="http://www.dstovall.com/" target="_blank">Drew</a> for sharing this with me.)</p>

<p>Notice how little energy alternative sources are producing. Also, notice that we&rsquo;re losing a ton of energy to transmission. In fact, if we could halve transmission losses we could eliminate all imports.</p>

<p>Does anything else stand out to you? More notable points than mine? Is the graphic missing data that you would like to see? Is energy independence truly achievable?</p>

<p><a title="Luis von Ahn at the Library of Congress" href="http://vonahn.blogspot.com/2009/06/speaking-at-library-of-congress.html" target="_blank"><a href="http://vonahn.blogspot.com/2009/06/speaking-at-library-of-congress.html">http://vonahn.blogspot.com/2009/06/speaking-at-library-of-congress.html</a></a></p>

<p>The talk covers the basics of a CAPTCHA (the hard-to-read words that verify you are human when signing up for online accounts) then discusses the recaptcha. The recaptcha pairs two random English words together so it can yield some funky phrases such as the &ldquo;desert voter&rdquo; shown below. (Watch the video for much better pairings!) The recaptcha uses one known word and one word that cannot be read by a machine. By distributing the otherwise unreadable word to multiple people, von Ahn is able to effortlessly digitize the written word. I respect and admire the ingenuity here. Dr. von Ahn simultaneously repels spammers and digitizes books!</p>

      <p>Over the weekend I went to Florida for a family reunion. Overall, I had a wonderful time; the biggest inconvenience was travel. Airports and air transportation are awful. It baffles me that everyone I talk to agrees (surely this sentiment is mirrored by more than the tens of people I&rsquo;ve spoken to), yet there are no improvements or innovations. I understand airplanes cost enormous amounts of money and there is a mountain of bureaucracy, but that does not placate me. On our most recent flight it occurred to me that airline seating is a 3-way optimization, yet no system mirrors the thought process. Seating is all about the location! There are three specific concerns:</p>

<ul>
<li>Sitting with specific people (people)</li>
<li>Sitting in a specific location relative to the entire plane (location)</li>
<li>Sitting in a specific location relative to the row (seat)</li>
</ul>


<p>A fair system would allow people to rank their priorities, then the system can simultaneously satisfy the highest number of people. This may seem a little abstract so allow me to illustrate with an example; here&rsquo;s my ideal:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>High Priority</strong>. <em>People</em>: I want to sit with Andrea Holloway</li>
<li><strong>Medium Priority</strong>. <em>Seat</em>: I want to sit on the aisle</li>
<li><strong>Low Priority</strong>. <em>Location</em>: I want to sit over the wing</li>
</ul>


<p>Why doesn&rsquo;t this simple system exist? Am I right about the three categories? How would you prioritize?</p>

      <p>I&rsquo;m a fan of effective visuals. I&rsquo;m also a fan of world religions. Boy, was I in luck whenever I received this link! It&rsquo;s a rather interesting perspective on how different religions generally feel about a few hot-button issues.</p>

<p>Going just on these issues, could one&rsquo;s beliefs align more strongly with a religion other than their own? Does your self-described religion share your beliefs on these issues? Are there more important issues to you?</p>
