The wedding was a beautiful, small affair in the hills overlooking Lake Travis. I hope all the guests had a good time&mdash;I know I did! My apologies if I did not get a chance to talk to you, or if you were not invited (space was limited).</p>

<p>We just got back from a short honeymoon on Canyon Lake. Thanks to Justin at the <a title="the lakehouse bed and breakfast on canyon lake" href="http://www.thelakehousebb.com" target="_blank">Lakehouse Bed and Breakfast</a> for a wonderful stay. I highly recommend this destination if you want to get away from it all without traveling for hours or breaking the bank.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re now trying to organize everything, merge old and new items, and establish some semblance of normalcy.</p>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/the-happening/">The Happening</a></h1>
      <p>We saw The Happening last night, the movie&rsquo;s opening night. Given M. Night Shyamalan&rsquo;s body of work, I had no idea what to expect; I went in with an open mind. The movie was bad; it was ever so thinly veiled trite scare tactics about humanity&rsquo;s effect on the Earth. The actors did a great job, but the story was lacking. Several objects seemed to be important, but they never panned out. Examples include the mood ring, the child, the hot dogs, the old woman. Any one of the aforementioned items could have led to a more cohesive story. Basically, any other ending would have been an improvement. Here are some options I thought of:</p>

<p>1) Make it a love story &ndash; the main characters could have saved humanity with their pure intentions.</p>

<p>2) Make it a horror film &ndash; whew! Almost any change in plot would have made The Happening a horror film. I think the old woman controlling the destruction would have been a grand climax.</p>

<p>3) Make it a dream &ndash; the ultimate cop-out in endings; however, The Happening could have wiped away at least some of the bad if the entire scene took place in a dream.</p>

<p>I was most disappointed at the fact that the movie was shallow and unfinished. Documentaries are en vogue currently, and the objectives of this movie are better served with a factual production.</p>

<p>Better luck next time M Night Shyamalan!</p>

      <p>After watching Sicko I have been more interested in the American health care situation. I don&rsquo;t trust the government to provide high-quality health care coverage. Moore speaks highly of the English system, but a common perk for jobs in the UK (<a title="effects on Brits who choose private health care" href="http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/tax-advice/income-tax/article.html?in_article_id=408244&amp;in_page_id=77" target="_blank">private health care coverage</a>) suggests that the system is less than perfect. Benefits of America&rsquo;s quasi-privatized system are a wash: a person can receive care, but insurance rarely covers the entire cost of operations and medicine. There are a number of other issues at work (governmental regulations, the patent system, market competition, a lack of care for mentally-ill, &hellip;); however, my intent for this post is not to cover any of these complex issues, nor is it to enrage people or debate over the advantages and disadvantages of private health care. Instead, I simply want to share a solution that I find very clever and achievable: <a title="LetWalMartFixUSHealthCare" href="http://articles.moneycentral.msn.com/Investing/JubaksJournal/LetWalMartFixUSHealthCare.aspx" target="_blank">Let Wal-Mart Fix American Health Care</a>.</p>

<p>If they can roll back prices on so many everyday products, they should be able to hardball health care providers and pass the savings on to the consumers. I&rsquo;ll worship the Church of Wal-Mart if it saves me any of the $3,600 a year I pay for health care (for <a title="Andrea and myself" href="http://andrea.sethholloway.com" target="_blank">two</a>).</p>

      <p>What is the resolution of unaltered human sight? Computers are slowly pushing their capability higher: from 800x600 to 1920x1200 and beyond. I&rsquo;m left wondering &ldquo;When will the screen resolution catch our innate capabilities?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The answer is not simple and estimates differ on the resolution (<a title="acuity, resolution, ...what now?" href="http://www.clarkvision.com/imagedetail/eye-resolution.html" target="_blank">324 megapixel</a>, <a title="deviantart estimate of human resolution" href="http://news.deviantart.com/article/27174/" target="_blank">576 megapixels</a> to <a title="vision" href="http://www.swift.ac.uk/vision.pdf" target="_blank">15 million megapixels</a>). In any case, our eyes will outperform technology for at least another year or two :) That&rsquo;s when genetic engineering can save the day!</p>

      <p>Mike, Tahra, Andrea, and I drove to New Orleans last weekend for a Mire-Holloway wedding shower. Overall, it was a blast: great food, great music, and great company.</p>

<p>The food
The trip could be defined by what we ate&mdash;New Orleans is definitely a food town. There were amazing meals at Acme Oyster House and the Bon Ton as well as our wedding shower.</p>

<p>The music
New Orleans is full of street performers tootin&#8217; on a horn or bangin&#8217; on a drum&mdash;all while begging! Luckily there was a good live band at the shower with no strings attached.</p>

<p>The company
I enjoyed meeting/seeing my future in-laws. There are lots of fun memories from the family and a few uniquely New Orleans characters. Wolfman Will sang some scat (read: spoke gibberish) before telling me he was the Woooooooooolfmaaaaaaaan Wheeeeeeeeel. Then there was the old guy who let us hold his trombone. And the bum yelling obscenities then asking for &ldquo;tree fiddy!&rdquo; Wait, that was the Loch Ness Monster! Long story short, I&rsquo;m a few dollars lighter but rich in social currency and karma.</p>

<p>To cap it all off we received a pile of great presents. We should get married more often, or at least celebrate our anniversary with everyone else buying us presents :)</p>

      <p>Andrea did not know about Find/Replace in document editors. Instead of replacing all occurrences of a word she was rereading an assignment. I showed her Find/Replace which not only found every occurrence, including some she had missed, the feature also saved her several minutes. As <a title="see the video on YouTube" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQUfzRF_drc" target="_blank">Kip says</a>, &ldquo;I still love technology! Always and forever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This random tidbit merely illustrates the benefits of being technical / surrounding yourself with technical people. Work smarter, not harder!</p>

<p>For anyone that does not know, most word processors and text editors (Google Docs, Microsoft Word, Open Office Writer, etc) have a feature that lets you find words and phrases matching your input. You can even replace the words and phrases. This functionality can save hours if you want to alter the style of a document, for example adding two spaces after a period. Find a period followed by a space, replace it with a period followed by two spaces. You can get fancier with <a title="chock full of information about regex" href="http://www.regular-expressions.info/" target="_blank">regular expressions</a>, but this is a start.</p>

      <p>I won&rsquo;t validate the ads by pointing them out, but we can all think of a number of annoying commercials. I suppose the marketeers who generated these wretched pieces truly believe that &ldquo;no press is bad press.&rdquo; Don&rsquo;t focus groups give feedback? I can&rsquo;t imagine anyone seeing such choice pieces of advertising and saying, &ldquo;YEAH! I want to buy X now!&rdquo;</p>

<p>More and more ads are moving online, but no one knows what works in online advertising. I block obnoxious ads online, but allow non-obtrusive, possibly even helpful, ads. Last night Mike and I discussed when we click on Google ads&mdash;and it&rsquo;s not when Google would like us to (i.e. all the time). I have to wonder if I&rsquo;m the standard user or a corner case. What brave new world awaits us with advertising?</p>

<p>By the way, I avoid most ads by using <a title="download firefox!" href="http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/" target="_blank">Firefox</a> with <a title="must have firefox add-on!" href="http://adblockplus.org" target="_blank">Adblock Plus</a>. If you&rsquo;re not already using these two, I&rsquo;d highly recommend it. (More to come later on this subject.) Opera 10 has built in ad-blocking although I don&rsquo;t find it works as well. To augment the service you can use Admuncher (I don&rsquo;t link because they charge a lot) or any other technique described on <a title="Ad filtering article on wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_filtering" target="_blank">wikipedia</a>.</p>
