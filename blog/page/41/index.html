      <p>Mike, Tahra, Andrea, and I drove to New Orleans last weekend for a Mire-Holloway wedding shower. Overall, it was a blast: great food, great music, and great company.</p>

<p>The food
The trip could be defined by what we ate&mdash;New Orleans is definitely a food town. There were amazing meals at Acme Oyster House and the Bon Ton as well as our wedding shower.</p>

<p>The music
New Orleans is full of street performers tootin&#8217; on a horn or bangin&#8217; on a drum&mdash;all while begging! Luckily there was a good live band at the shower with no strings attached.</p>

<p>The company
I enjoyed meeting/seeing my future in-laws. There are lots of fun memories from the family and a few uniquely New Orleans characters. Wolfman Will sang some scat (read: spoke gibberish) before telling me he was the Woooooooooolfmaaaaaaaan Wheeeeeeeeel. Then there was the old guy who let us hold his trombone. And the bum yelling obscenities then asking for &ldquo;tree fiddy!&rdquo; Wait, that was the Loch Ness Monster! Long story short, I&rsquo;m a few dollars lighter but rich in social currency and karma.</p>

<p>To cap it all off we received a pile of great presents. We should get married more often, or at least celebrate our anniversary with everyone else buying us presents :)</p>

      <p>Andrea did not know about Find/Replace in document editors. Instead of replacing all occurrences of a word she was rereading an assignment. I showed her Find/Replace which not only found every occurrence, including some she had missed, the feature also saved her several minutes. As <a title="see the video on YouTube" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQUfzRF_drc" target="_blank">Kip says</a>, &ldquo;I still love technology! Always and forever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This random tidbit merely illustrates the benefits of being technical / surrounding yourself with technical people. Work smarter, not harder!</p>

<p>For anyone that does not know, most word processors and text editors (Google Docs, Microsoft Word, Open Office Writer, etc) have a feature that lets you find words and phrases matching your input. You can even replace the words and phrases. This functionality can save hours if you want to alter the style of a document, for example adding two spaces after a period. Find a period followed by a space, replace it with a period followed by two spaces. You can get fancier with <a title="chock full of information about regex" href="http://www.regular-expressions.info/" target="_blank">regular expressions</a>, but this is a start.</p>

      <p>I won&rsquo;t validate the ads by pointing them out, but we can all think of a number of annoying commercials. I suppose the marketeers who generated these wretched pieces truly believe that &ldquo;no press is bad press.&rdquo; Don&rsquo;t focus groups give feedback? I can&rsquo;t imagine anyone seeing such choice pieces of advertising and saying, &ldquo;YEAH! I want to buy X now!&rdquo;</p>

<p>More and more ads are moving online, but no one knows what works in online advertising. I block obnoxious ads online, but allow non-obtrusive, possibly even helpful, ads. Last night Mike and I discussed when we click on Google ads&mdash;and it&rsquo;s not when Google would like us to (i.e. all the time). I have to wonder if I&rsquo;m the standard user or a corner case. What brave new world awaits us with advertising?</p>

<p>By the way, I avoid most ads by using <a title="download firefox!" href="http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/" target="_blank">Firefox</a> with <a title="must have firefox add-on!" href="http://adblockplus.org" target="_blank">Adblock Plus</a>. If you&rsquo;re not already using these two, I&rsquo;d highly recommend it. (More to come later on this subject.) Opera 10 has built in ad-blocking although I don&rsquo;t find it works as well. To augment the service you can use Admuncher (I don&rsquo;t link because they charge a lot) or any other technique described on <a title="Ad filtering article on wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_filtering" target="_blank">wikipedia</a>.</p>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/mmorpgs/">MMORPGs</a></h1>
      <p>MMORPGs have been on my mind recently. Yesterday I was talking to a co-worker who is a hardcore gamer: he played three accounts at once in EQ, he plays two in WoW, he has every console, etc. It occurred to me that one reason he likes the games is because he plays an entire group by himself, so the entire game is open to him.</p>

<p>WoW has terrible soloability; solo quests and PvE are mindless, I mean it can be automated pretty easily (I would know :-o). However, there&rsquo;s no way you can solo any dungeon until you&rsquo;re 20+ levels above it, and all end game content requires at least one other person (PvP arenas) and up to 39 others (40 man raids). I personally do not want to join a random guild with random people; I don&rsquo;t want to have to try to make friends in MMOs&mdash;I want to play by myself, anytime, or with my friends. In Ultima Online friends seemed to come more naturally, and you could solo almost everything so the entire game was accessible. DAoC gave group bonuses so it was beneficial to group with anyone you could find.</p>

<p>Another big problem I have with WoW is the fact that the game revolves entirely around gear. The best gear wins everytime. The best gear is a pain to get (long, hard quests or massive dungeon runs with virtually no chance of getting the drop). The difficulty of getting gear inherently favors the hardcore and leads to another nasty feature: soulbound items. Soulbound has at least two negative effects:</p>

<p>1), you cannot trade/sell gear which hurts the economy and is unfair to users with multiple characters&mdash;you can&rsquo;t even trade your own items to yourself!</p>

<p>2) people with the best gear will always have the best gear&mdash;there&rsquo;s no way to lose it; armor&rsquo;s broken, repair, done. In UO items were easy-come, easy-go which made for a much more casual feel and required much less time. UO also lowered the gap between a hoss in the best gear with perfect skills and a newbie with starter gear and no skills; everyone was competitive and could have fun. The point of this gargantuan post is that MMORPGs are not out of the casual gamers reach; we simply need the right game (with high soloability and little reliance on gear/level). I hope a game satisfying these requirements will come out soon although I doubt I&rsquo;ll play.</p>

      <p>Where&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s a will, there&rsquo;s a way. And likely, if there&rsquo;s a will, there&rsquo;s money. We&rsquo;ve all felt the effects of spam in our email, but some of you may have never seen the amount of spam posted to blogs. Once a day I have to moderate comments with content similar to that of spam email. While that may not sound like much, I am grossly understating the achievement of finding my blog. Try googling for &ldquo;<a title="google for blog" href="http://www.google.com/search?q=blog" target="_blank">blog</a>&rdquo; and you will not find my site easily.</p>

<p>The level of sophistication necessary to post spam on blogs is very high: <a title="google for seth holloway blog and you still may not find me" href="http://www.google.com/search?q=seth+holloway+blog" target="_blank">find a blog</a>, find a post, click to comment, paste in the spam, click to add the comments, and repeat. Anyone with the skills to do so could be gainfully employed as a programmer. What does it say that some would choose to be spammers instead? Hmmm&hellip;</p>

<p>Truth be told, a lot of spam is created by <a title="wikipedia article -- feed your brain" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Script_kiddies" target="_blank">script kiddies</a> who download an easy-to-use hacking kit and start doing their thing. There&rsquo;s something inherently strange about trusting a stranger to furnish tools specifically for illegal, or at least maligned, activity. For example, <a title="netcraft article on phishing fraud" href="http://news.netcraft.com/archives/2008/01/22/mrbrain_stealing_phish_from_fraudsters.html" target="_blank">this story</a> gives details on how a hacking group released a phishing kit that benefits the original group as much as the script kiddie using the package.</p>

<p>Spam is not going away until we make it unprofitable. Although it is hard to stop, please do the world a favor and stop buying all those penis pills you heard about from the stranger online.</p>

<p>UPDATE: This post was more about my continuing amazement with nefarious people, but <a href="http://www.laneholloway.com" target="_blank">Lane</a> informed me of the <a href="http://akismet.com/" target="_blank">Akismet</a> plugin to fight comment spam which the nice folks at <a href="http://www.wordpress.org" target="_blank">Wordpress</a> talk about <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Combating_Comment_Spam" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>Apparently GUI automation tools are so easy to use that any decent programmer can develop a script to post spam arbitrarily. Very clever. Very cool. Luckily, the counter measure to comment-spam is equally elegant.</p>

<p>Ahhh, and a good chuckle because the first comment on this post was spam&hellip;</p>

      <p>We&rsquo;ve all felt the crunch of deadlines and work piling up,  as we balance the working world and the life we&rsquo;re meant to live. In this busy, always-on environment, I am a big fan of getting things done. I am also open to suggestions. In an effort to improve my productivity I went to the &ldquo;experts&rdquo; that I found online, namely <a title="lifehack - waste time mining for precious little gold" href="http://www.lifehack.org/" target="_blank">lifehack</a>&mdash;a website touting useful resources in personal productivity. However, the official <a title="do not waste your time by checking the lifehack blog =)" href="http://www.sethholloway.com/blog/">lifehack blog</a> fills with overblown, verbose posts like <a title="zzz" href="http://www.lifehack.org/articles/lifehack/big-blokes-in-skirts.html" target="_blank">this one</a> that took me minutes to read and essentially said&hellip; well, nothing.</p>

<p>I prefer the minimalistic approach of <a title="say it in five sentences" href="http://five.sentenc.es/"><a href="http://five.sentenc.es">http://five.sentenc.es</a></a> who practice what they preach. We as information consumers should not support these modern-day Dickens who write like they&rsquo;re paid by the word. Even worse are the wolves-in-sheep-clothing producers who waste your time instead of improving your efficiency. In the interest of not wasting your time, I&rsquo;m done with this rant now.</p>
