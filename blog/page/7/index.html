      <h1 class="link"><a href="/search-has-to-solve-versioning/">Search has to solve versioning</a></h1>
      <p>Search has been failing me frequently in the recent past, and the problem is only getting worse. Versions are everywhere and search is not keeping up. Here are a few examples:</p>

<ul>
<li>Googling for &ldquo;mac lion&rdquo; returns 5 results for Lion and 5 for Mountain Lion on the first page. Specifying version number (e.g., &ldquo;mac lion 10.7&rdquo;) or date (e.g., &ldquo;mac lion 2011&rdquo;) does not particularly help the results.</li>
<li>World of Warcraft has repeated some items with each expansion (or retooled bosses like Onyxia and even whole zones like Naxxramus). Searching for the item may lead you to the 2010 incarnation. Simply adding 2012 or the expansion name is often ineffective because the pages will contain dates and expansion names throughout the content. Another example: there are over <a title="Fortune Card -- what version???" href="http://www.wowhead.com/item=60840/fortune-card">50 virtually identical fortune cards</a>.</li>
<li>A similar idea occurs in GitHub branches. For example, if you&rsquo;re looking for <a title="Toopher Ruby" href="https://github.com/toopher/toopher-ruby">Toopher&rsquo;s Ruby client</a> (which rocks!) then you might find my fork that was already merged with master.</li>
<li>In my personalized search results for &ldquo;cross platform password management,&rdquo; Google returns an outdated <a title="Outdated -- Lifehacker's five best password managers" href="http://lifehacker.com/5042616/five-best-password-managers">Lifehacker article from 2008</a> above more recent articles. In this case, recency trumps Lifehacker&rsquo;s relevance and authority.</li>
<li>While learning Clojure (at version 1.4) I kept finding StackOverflow responses like, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s how to do it in Clojure 1.2.&rdquo; The more dangerous response was &ldquo;here&rsquo;s how to do it in Clojure&rdquo; with no mention of versioning. I spent hours trying to get the outdated procedures to work only to have them fail.</li>
<li>There are bugs that exist for certain operating systems with certain versions of dependent projects. Like <a title="Ruby 1.9.2 seg faults with OpenSSL" href="http://www.christopherirish.com/2011/09/02/ruby-1-9-2-segmentation-fault-and-openssl/">Ruby 1.9.2+ on Mac OS X Lion when installed with RVM 1.0 or higher</a>. Searching for this was difficult because it required so many versions.</li>
</ul>


<p>Some of these examples would be prevented by using advanced search options and narrowing results to the past year; however, I feel that&rsquo;s a cop-out for a poor user experience.</p>

<p>Until search engines gain additional processing, I think we should get familiar with scoping search results and ask that answers contain version information for increased searchability.</p>

<p>I think search has to solve versioning&ndash;what do you think?</p>

      <p>Over the years I have played with a few different resume styles. I had the <a title="Seth Holloway's outdated LaTeX resume" href="https://github.com/smholloway/resume/tree/master/latex">LaTeX template</a>, the <a title="Seth Holloway's timeline resume" href="http://www.sethholloway.com/timelineResume.html">timeline resume</a>, the <a title="Seth Holloway's responsive design resume" href="http://www.sethholloway.com/resume.html">responsive resume</a> (resize your browser or check it out on your phone), and the old school World of Warcraft character builder style resume. This post is meant to showcase the RPG character builder resume that I never publicized. Check it out:</p>

<p>If the screenshot leaves you wanting, you can see my <a title="Seth Holloway RPG Character Builder Resume" href="http://sethholloway.com/alternativeResume.html">RPG style resume live</a> and check out <a title="WoW character builder" href="http://wowtal.com/#k=ff-.bqj.druid.">World of Warcraft Character Builder</a> for the inspiration.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve also <a title="Seth Holloway's resumes on GitHub " href="https://github.com/smholloway/resume">open sourced the resumes</a>. The individual READMEs there provide some more information about each template. I hope others will find this interesting and valuable.</p>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/lisp-and-order-of-operations-pemdas/">Lisp and order of operations (PEMDAS)</a></h1>
      <p>Somewhere around third grade I had the order of operations drilled into my head: parentheses, exponent, multiplication, division, addition, subtraction&ndash;abbreviated as PEMDAS and pronounced &ldquo;pem doss.&rdquo; PEMDAS allows you to succinctly communicate mathematical expressions.</p>

<p>5 + 3<sup>2</sup> * 7</p>

<p>Moving through PEMDAS we see there are no parentheses, but there is an exponent: 3<sup>2</sup> == 3*3 == 9. Continuing through PEMDAS we hit the M for multiplication; our example has the middle term multiplied by 7. Finally, we add 5.</p>

<p>Written in a Lisp style the same expression would look something like this:</p>

<p>(+ 5 (* 7 (pow 3 2)))</p>

<p>Rules implicitly encoded in math must be explicitly written in Lisp (or any pre- or post-fix notation for that matter). In various other languages (<a title="REPL.it is a collection of online REPLs" href="http://repl.it" target="_blank">try a few</a>) the order of operations is encoded already.</p>

<p>In a way, it is frustrating that the programming language ignores basic math rules; however, there may be benefits. I wonder, how many bugs would have been avoided by forcing people to use parentheses to group expressions? how much slower was it to type the extra keystrokes? how many future Lispers were snuffed out by explicit mathematics?</p>

<p>How do you feel about the encoding? Does pre-fix notation bother you more in another way?</p>

      <p>When I get good at something I tend to lose empathy for beginners. I&rsquo;m not unique in that regard. Reflecting on negative experiences, it was often when a senior person made me feel dumb for being new. This happens at work, in life, even in school (how many college profs answer questions gracefully?).</p>

<p>To counteract the loss of connection, I think it is important to always be a novice at something. Said another way, always be learning.</p>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/tv-should-be-more-interactive/">TV should be more interactive</a></h1>
      <p>TV is such a dinosaur! If I see something I want in a commercial, I have to use a second&ndash;maybe even third&ndash;device to find out more and buy it. Let&rsquo;s say I see a movie trailer and I decide I want to see the movie; currently, the onus is on me to remember. Because we have poor memories, we are inundated with the same trailer as an artificial memory aid.</p>

<p>If a movie is coming out on video, I would like to be able to add it to my Netflix queue or have a reminder to check it out on Redbox. If I see a product that I&rsquo;d like to buy, it would be nice to have a simpler method than visiting a website, calling a specified number, or both. Voting, like on American Idol, is another clear example of where TV could be more interactive.</p>

<p>Today we have Internet-enabled TVs and on-demand programs, but that&rsquo;s done little to improve the interactivity. Why have we seen disappointingly little innovation in TV?</p>

      <p>I&rsquo;ve been watching a lot of videos from conferences recently, and I&rsquo;ve noticed a disturbing trend: speakers say &ldquo;right&rdquo; a lot. Like every sentence.

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/keeping-up-with-technology/">Keeping up with Technology</a></h1>
      <p>Keeping up with technology sometimes feels like a full-time job. Everyday there are new and interesting books, articles, projects, videos and more coming out! That&rsquo;s on top of ton of history that is worth learning (and not repeating). And that just covers industry. Academia piles on even more to master.</p>

<p>At first, learning all these things feels completely overwhelming; however, once you build a base and learn how to learn, it is not so bad. Graduate school hones these skills, as does working in a fast-paced, dynamic environment. If neither is an option, experiment with the different mediums below and you will reap the rewards.</p>

<p>Below is a list of ways that I keep up with technology. The list is organized as person-to-person and solo.</p>

<p>If you have a different approach or a great site, please let me know!</p>

<h1>Person-to-person</h1>

<p>People are social creatures. We are one of the only species capable of learning from others, so person-to-person is a very natural avenue. That being said, it does require more time and energy to alter your routine and attend these structured events.</p>

<h2>Local events</h2>

<p>If you&rsquo;re feeling social, local meetings are a fantastic way to find smart, interesting people. Around Austin we have something technical happening virtually every night of the month (see these lists: <a href="http://door64.com/calendar?" target="_blank"><a href="http://door64.com/calendar?">http://door64.com/calendar?</a></a> | <a href="http://geekaustin.org/guide-austin-tech-meetups" target="_blank"><a href="http://geekaustin.org/guide-austin-tech-meetups">http://geekaustin.org/guide-austin-tech-meetups</a></a> | Austin Tech Meetups: <a href="http://www.meetup.com/find/?mcName=Austin&amp;categories=34" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.meetup.com/find/?mcName=Austin&amp;amp;categories=34">http://www.meetup.com/find/?mcName=Austin&amp;amp;categories=34</a></a>). A couple that I&rsquo;ve been to and enjoyed include the <a title="Austin Java User's Group" href="http://www.austinjug.org/" target="_blank">Austin Java User’s Group</a> and <a title="Austin on Rails" href="http://austinonrails.org/" target="_blank">Austin on Rails</a>.</p>

<h2>Conferences</h2>

<p>There are a number of potentially worthwhile conferences, both academic and industrial. I&rsquo;ve been to several academic conferences, which were worthwhile for graduate research. I have not been to an industry conference, but I&rsquo;d be interested to attend <a title="No Fluff Just Stuff Conference" href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/home/main" target="_blank">No Fluff Just Stuff</a> and <a title="The Strange Loop Conference" href="https://thestrangeloop.com/" target="_blank">Strange Loop</a>.</p>

<h2>Groups and Mailing Lists, Twitter, and Google Plus</h2>

<p>Personally, I prefer website interactions, but I would be remiss if I omitted social media and newsgroups. While you can choose to lurk with all of these methods, at least the opportunities for interaction are there :)</p>

<p>Want to keep up with what&rsquo;s going on with Clojure? Just join the <a title="Clojure on Google Groups" href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/clojure">Clojure mailing list</a>. Whatever you&rsquo;re interested in, search for the group and join it. You can also follow the discussion on Twitter or Google Plus. This is a great way to find out who&rsquo;s who in the community.</p>

<h1>Solo</h1>

<p>If you&rsquo;re not feeling social, there are a ton of more solitary options. I love the asynchronous nature of in-person learning: if I have five minutes I can sneak in some learning without coordinating with anyone else.</p>

<h2>Books</h2>

<p>I like to balance theory and application, so I split time between learning by doing and learning by reading. Two of my favorite books (below) concisely capture years of lessons learned and provide a vocabulary for interacting with others in the field.</p>

<ul>
<li><a title="Amazon: Clean Code" href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0132350882">Clean Code by Robert Martin</a></li>
<li><a title="Amazon: The Pragmatic Programmer" href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/020161622X">The Pragmatic Programmer by Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas</a></li>
</ul>

</ul>


<h2>Websites</h2>

<p>There&rsquo;s a website for everything, right? The trick is finding worthwhile ones. A few of my favorite aggregators are</p>

<ul>
<li>Hacker <a href="News:%C2%A0">News:%C2%A0</a><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/">http://news.ycombinator.com/</a></li>
<li>Reddit Programming: <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Programming" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Programming">http://www.reddit.com/r/Programming</a></a></li>
<li>InfoQ: <a href="http://www.infoq.com/" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.infoq.com/">http://www.infoq.com/</a></a></li>
</ul>


<p>From here, I can find interesting articles and people to follow.</p>

<p>To keep up with myriad websites, I recommend RSS, particularly <a title="Google Reader" href="http://www.google.com/reader/" target="_blank">Google Reader</a>, which is free&ndash;you just need a Google account. Reader links to Plus fairly easily, so you can share interesting content pretty easily.</p>

<h2>Podcasts</h2>

<p>For iOS devices, I love the Downcast app (<a href="http://www.downcastapp.com/" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.downcastapp.com/">http://www.downcastapp.com/</a></a>). Some of my favorite podcasts so far include</p>

<ul>
<li><a title="Software Engineering Radio podcast" href="http://www.se-radio.net/" target="_blank">Software Engineering Radio</a></li>
<li><a title="Java Posse" href="http://javaposse.com/" target="_blank">Java Posse</a></li>
<li><a title="Ruby Rogues" href="http://rubyrogues.com/" target="_blank">Ruby Rogues</a></li>
<li><a title="Herding Code" href="http://herdingcode.com/" target="_blank">Herding Code</a></li>
</ul>


<h2>Online Learning and Videos</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve covered online learning previously, so I will simply point to my post <a title="Online Learning is Taking Off" href="http://sethholloway.com/blog/2012/07/22/online-learning-is-taking-off/" target="_blank">Online Learning is Taking Off</a>.</p>

<h2>Read Code</h2>

<p>Some would say that reading code is as important as writing code. Luckily, code is easier to find than ever! For example, check out a popular repo lik <a title="browse Google Guava source" href="http://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/source/browse/" target="_blank">Google Guava</a> or let <a title="GitHub Explore" href="https://github.com/explore" target="_blank">GitHub guide you</a>.</p>

<h2>What do you think?</h2>

<p>Did I miss something? Would you categorize differently? What&rsquo;s your preferred method of keeping up with tech?</p>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/twiki-health-checker/">Twiki Health Checker</a></h1>
      <p>A few months ago I got tired of staring at pages of cruft while navigating the Twiki at work. My friend and peer, Otto, suggested that we try to filter those less-than-helpful posts. I couldn&rsquo;t find any tools to help non-administrators, so I figured I&rsquo;d need to write something myself. That night I wrote some JavaScript to quickly find posts in the Twiki WebIndex that were outdated or written by an unknown author. Once found, the entries are highlighted. The idea was that people would run the code against the Twiki, then delete the marked entries. After a couple code reviews (thanks Derek and Nick!), the script was packaged and put onto GitHub as the <a title="GitHub - Seth Holloway - TwikiChecker" href="https://github.com/smholloway/TwikiChecker">TwikiChecker</a> a.k.a. Twiki Health Checker.</p>

<p><img class="size-large wp-image-1804" title="TwikiChecker run on Twiki WebIndex" src="/images/delthis-1024x399.png" alt="TwikiChecker run on Twiki WebIndex" width="640" height="249" /></p>

<p>Try running it for yourself on the official Twiki page, <a title="http://twiki.org/cgi-bin/view/TWiki/WebIndex" href="http://twiki.org/cgi-bin/view/TWiki/WebIndex"><a href="http://twiki.org/cgi-bin/view/TWiki/WebIndex">http://twiki.org/cgi-bin/view/TWiki/WebIndex</a></a>. (Copy the contents of TwikiChecker.js, navigate to the Twiki WebIndex, open your browser&rsquo;s JavaScript console, paste in the contents and hit enter.)</p>

<p>Hopefully this is useful for others!</p>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/whats-your-average-likert-scale-response/">What&#8217;s your average Likert scale response?</a></h1>
      <p>Have you ever seen a question where you select an answer from a set list like <em>Strongly disagree</em>, <em>Disagree</em>, <em>Neither agree nor disagree</em>, <em>Agree</em>, and <em>Strongly agree</em>? that&rsquo;s a <a title="Wikipedia: Likert Scale" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likert_scale">Likert scale</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cc/Example_Likert_Scale.svg/220px-Example_Likert_Scale.svg.png"><img class="alignnone" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cc/Example_Likert_Scale.svg/220px-Example_Likert_Scale.svg.png" alt="" width="220" height="334" /></a></p>

<p>Crafting a survey like this is very straightforward and easy, but doing it well is very difficult! For example, this style of survey is lacking the granularity necessary to capture answers like, &ldquo;I can see both sides&rdquo; or &ldquo;Not applicable&rdquo; or &ldquo;This question warrants a richer discussion and should not be shoe-horned into a simple yes or no question.&rdquo; Let&rsquo;s forget about the problems and instead focus on appropriate usage of the Likert scale.</p>

<p>Think about the last questionnaire like this that you completed. What was your average response? I&rsquo;ll guess your responses were entirely in one column (more precisely, your standard deviation between responses was low). If you were asked about a crappy restaurant experience you might answer all negatively: that the food was bad, the service was bad, the decor was bad, and the price was bad. If you were asked about your feelings about something you didn&rsquo;t care about you would probably hover around the middle choice (<em>Neither agree nor disagree</em> in our example above).</p>

<p>Personally, I think that presenting an odd number of options is folly. In my experience, people choose the middle option most often. The middle is safe and easy. But that&rsquo;s not informative! Questions should not be simplified into <em>Neither agree nor disagree</em>. Everyone feels more strongly one way or another.</p>

<p>The next time you respond to a survey that uses a Likert scale, do this:</p>

<ul>
<li>remember the term &ldquo;Likert scale&rdquo; and applaud yourself for exercising your knowledge</li>
<li>avoid the simple middle answer&ndash;think a second and decide if you really feel a bit more to one side</li>
<li>take note of how positive or negative you are</li>
</ul>
