      <h1 class="link"><a href="/advertising-on-linkedin-sucks/">Advertising on LinkedIn (Sucks)</a></h1>
      <p>As part of creating a business page for <a title="Oilfield Intel: oil and gas service and equipment reviews" href="http://oilfieldintelligence.com">Oilfield Intelligence</a>Â (a niche review site for oil and gas services and equipment), LinkedIn kindly provided $50 worth of credit for their ads. That was enough to entice me, so I set up the ads. Four pages: create your ads, choose your target audience, select pay for impressions or clicks, and input payment information.</p>

<p>At first I chose to pay per click (CPC), but they were charging close to $5.00 per. Ouch! We do not have metrics for how much a single visitor is worth, but I suspect it is much less than $5.00 each and that&rsquo;s if we had 100% conversion rate. Normal consumer web apps run around 1% conversion rate, so you&rsquo;d need 100 people on your page before one signed up. At $5.00 per person, that&rsquo;s $500 per new account. Yikes! Unfortunately, by the time I had done the math and researched a bit more, my LinkedIn session had expired (really? log me out in a few minutes?).</p>

<p>So, I return to the page and recreate the ads, choose who I want to target, choose PPC, and hit next. It&rsquo;s a payment form, and I owe them $5 for setting up my account! At this point I&rsquo;m feeling like I got the bait-and-switch: $50 &ldquo;free advertising&rdquo; for a $5 sign-up is a good deal, but it felt shady. I&rsquo;m looking to see where I can set the limit on ad spending so I don&rsquo;t have to pay anything out-of-pocket (it&rsquo;s only an experiment, so I don&rsquo;t want to shell out a lot of money before I can at least make a weak approximation at its value); there&rsquo;s nothing you can do to limit your spending, except set the limit per day and the number of days to run. Again, this feels rather shady since the minimum per day is $10 so they&rsquo;ll have me for $10 everyday that I forget to turn the advertising off. Ugh. &ldquo;Fine,&rdquo; I think, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go back and cap it at $10 per day for 5 days.&rdquo; The payment form has virtually no navigation. You can go forward (submit your information) or return to LinkedIn, but not back to the previous three pages. I press my back button and see the familiar &lsquo;resubmit form&rsquo; dialog. I click to resubmit and I&rsquo;m routed to the homepage&hellip;</p>

<p>A third time, I begin the ads process because nothing has been saved. I re-create the ads, re-target the ads, then adjust the costs and move on to payment information.Â Apparently something had been saved! After several minutes of duplicated effort, I find that I have already set-up my account and they just need my payment information. I&rsquo;m not sure why they could not tell me that on the first three pages.</p>

<p>This morning, I log in and check the report:</p>

<div>

<img class="size-medium wp-image-1479" title="OI-LinkedIn-Ad-Metrics" src="/images/OI-LinkedIn-Ads-300x30.png" alt="OI LinkedIn Ad Metrics" width="300" height="30" />

</div>


<p>They had served the ad almost 6,000 times! And of those 6,000 impressions, we received two clicks. LinkedIn estimates those clicks to be worth $6.16! Good thing I am only paying for impressions&hellip; I am paying for impressions, right? That screenshot says I&rsquo;ve spent $12.32. Checking the billing, I see this:</p>

<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-1480" title="OI-LinkedIn-Ad-Costs" src="/images/OI-LinkedIn-Ad-Costs-300x28.png" alt="OI LinkedIn Ad Costs" width="300" height="28" /></p>

<p>The image shows that I had spent $2.57, a number that I am baffled by. The other page says I&rsquo;ve spent $12.32 based on two clicks worth $6.16 each. $2.57 is closer to the cost per 1,000 impressions, but I never chose that budget. In one pass through the ad setup I agreed to pay around $3.50 per click (not $6.16); on another I agreed to pay $2.00 per 1,000 impressions (the lowest you can go); and on another pass it was $2.50 per 1,000 impressions. Never $2.57. Weird.</p>

<p>My initial impressions?Â AdvertisingÂ on LinkedIn sucks. The site feels like an alpha release (as in not even ready for beta, much less a full product). The UI and information sharing is awful (how much have I actually spent and where did that number come from?). The setup is confusing. The navigation is weak. Perhaps worst of all, the ad placement is &ldquo;unobtrusive&rdquo; to put it nicely; more bluntly, the UI is cluttered and I cannot find the ads I&rsquo;m paying above market rates for. I plan to use up the $50 credit then abandon the platform until substantial upgrades are made.</p>

<p>Compared to Google: Google offered $100 worth of AdWords credit&ndash;twice what LinkedIn is willing to part with. My Google ads are costing $0.39 per click&ndash;over ten times less expensive than LinkedIn! Google&rsquo;s setup and reporting are markedly better.</p>

<p>Compared to Facebook: the <a title="Oilfield Intelligence on Facebook" href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Oilfield-Intelligence/256146977729169">OI Facebook page</a> seems to be ranked way higher than the <a title="Oilfield Intelligence official page on LinkedIn" href="http://www.linkedin.com/company/oilfield-intelligence">OI LinkedIn page</a>. I interpret that to mean that the Facebook page is a better use of our time than LinkedIn in general. Reading about ads, both LinkedIn and Facebook offer anÂ abysmalÂ 0.1% click-through-rate, so the cost per 1,000 impressions is usually equal to the cost per click.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll admit I&rsquo;m new to setting up CPC campaigns, but LinkedIn just seems bad.Â Am I missing something?</p>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/cmo-initiatives/">CMO Initiatives</a></h1>
      <p>A few days ago I wrote about the <a title="Seth Holloway: Chief Morale Officer (CMO)" href="http://sethholloway.com/blog/2011/08/22/cmo-chief-morale-officer/">Chief Morale Officer</a>, an important role that I think more companies should fill. The previous post is a bit high level, so I thought I&rsquo;d be more concrete and enumerate a few ideas on how to improve morale.</p>

<ul>
<li>At the core, I&rsquo;d say companies need to respect and empower employees. Focus on happiness with a focus on each employee achieving mastery, autonomy, and purpose.</li>
<li>Our <a title="Wikipedia: Dunbar's Number" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar's_number">primate brains can only handle between 100 and 230 connections</a>, so units and teams should be built with this in mind. Recent experiments have shown that compassion and respect are inverse with the gap in pay and humanity (tall organizational structures with tons of people in between top and bottom).</li>
<li><p>Trying to handle real-life matters is stressful when you&rsquo;re stuck at work during normal business hours; for example, when are you going to get your car fixed? The mechanic is open from 6am-6pm and you need your car to get to work, so before work is really inconvenient; if you&rsquo;re at work until 5pm then you won&rsquo;t get to the mechanic until 5:30pm and then you&rsquo;re competing with everyone else in the same situation. You&rsquo;re unlikely to get your car back before the next day, but wait! you need your car to get to work&hellip;Â A few ideas to alleviate stress from similar situations:</p>

<ul>
<li>four day work weeks (work 40 hours in 4 days then take the 5th day off) or 9/80 (work 80 hours in 9 days then take the 10th day off)</li>
<li>flexible start and end times</li>
<li>the ability to telecommute (at least once a week)</li>
<li>half-day hump day (9 hours Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday and 4 hours on Wednesday). Kids love half days a school; I think big kids would enjoy it too.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Some people never take a day off and others take more than their allotment, but I think the American average is to err on the side of caution and work. Â It is difficult to take vacation when there is a deadline looming. Everyone else is still working, so people often feel they cannot, in good conscience, take vacation. To combat this, I would shut the company down a couple weeks a year: early summer and late December. This would give the employee two solid weeks off and ease their mind because it is officially okay to enjoy yourself.</p></li>
<li>Employees should personally continue to improve their skills and stay abreast of market trends, but companies can help too. A little consistent training over many years leads to an exponentially more knowledgeable employee. This is also a huge perk! Companies can say, &ldquo;Come to our company and continue to grow and learn! You will not be bored.&rdquo; Something as simple as a weekly lunch and learn could help employees stay productive while still learning new things. Another approach to learning new things is short stints in a different role.Â Adult internships are becoming more common, and I think companies should internalize that by allowing employees to check out a different area for a period (perhaps in blocks ranging from 4 hours to 1 work-week). Exploring other teams and other functions is very healthy. Seeing how others work and what they do has numerous benefits like: (1) diffusing knowledge allowing observer and observee to learn and teach, (2) mitigating risk that only one person knows how to perform any action, and (3) increasing empathy.</li>
<li>Empower employees to make the decisions they need. How many times have you had to wait while a surly, unhappy employee retrieves the manager? That&rsquo;s not a fun position for the customer or the employee. A toy example: the doorman can be President of Greeting who is personally responsible for making everyone smile. He/she could access to coupons, vouchers, umbrellas, etc and be able to talk to managers who could benefit from his/her observations.</li>
<li>Encourage people to maintain clean, personalized spaces. <a title="Fog Creek Blog: Price of Developer Happiness" href="http://blog.fogcreek.com/the-price-of-dev-happiness-part-one/">At the high end a fully appointed developer setup is $6,174</a>. Businesses are nothing without employees and the <a title="CNN: Revenue per Employee" href="http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune500/2007/performers/industries/revenues_per_employee/index.html">revenue per employee can be thousands or more per year</a>, so providing a clean, comfortable working area is a small investment with a huge ROI. If you&rsquo;re running lean, allowing people to bring in materials and make their cube more hospitable costs you nothing but can improve morale and productivity.</li>
<li>Operate with transparency and openness, flatten the structures and allow people to communicate across levels. I think this is where a CMO would have real power&ndash;they could act as a bridge between management and employees. Everyone wants respect. They want to be heard. Stories from some successful companies mention that the CEO spends a few minutes per day talking to random employees. People love these CEOs and it keeps the CEO in touch with the pulse of the people. How empowering for both sides. Awesome!</li>
</ul>

<p>Well, I think that&rsquo;s enough for now! There are more ideas, lots of literature to read, and experiments to be done! I leave you with a <a title="TED: Shawn Achor" href="http://tedxtalks.ted.com/video/TEDxBloomington-Shawn-Achor-The">great video on positive psychology</a>Â (If it doesn&rsquo;t play above, the video is a TED talk by Shawn Achor).</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s your best idea for how to improve your own morale? What about a sweeping change to help all employees&#8217; morale?</p>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/black-out-glass-a-way-to-keep-cars-cool-and-more/">Reflective glass: a way to keep cars cool&#8230; and more</a></h1>
      <p>I have several ideas of how we could improve cars and driving; I imagine the subject is pretty common because we&rsquo;re surrounded by and rely so heavily on vehicles. I previously talked about<a title="Seth Holloway: Confiurable UI in cars" href="http://sethholloway.com/blog/2011/01/14/idea-configurable-user-interfaces-in-cars/"> improving cars usability by allowing users to configure their displays and controls</a>. With the recent heat wave I can&rsquo;t help but think of ways to help keep cars cool. A lot of us use car shades to block a bit of the sun, but we could do better in terms of efficiency and ease-of-use. The idea I keep coming to: cars could automatically black-out the glass when the car is off. (The technology exists and is called <a title="Wikipedia: Smart Glass" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_glass">smart glass</a>.)</p>

<p>Having heavily tinted windows would keep the car cooler, but the benefits don&rsquo;t stop there! This would also provide security because people would not be able to see your valuables. Smart glass would also greatly increase privacy as no one could see if you&rsquo;re in the car changing clothes, shaving, taking a nap, etc.</p>

<p>I do not know of any cars that apply the technology, but I saw the idea &ldquo;implemented&rdquo; in the vampire movie Daybreakers. The trailer quickly shows how the <a title="YouTube: Daybreakers Trailer" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8yYNDygdZs&amp;t=64">vampire can black out the windows in his car around 1:04 in</a>. Have you seen the concept anywhere else?</p>

<p>What would this feature be worth to you? I think I&rsquo;d be comfortable paying another thousand dollars for a car using smart glass that would stay cooler in the summer, provided added security and allow more privacy. What do you think?</p>

<p><em>Update</em>: Steve pointed out the physics fail of having black windows (black would absorb the heat and the glass would trap it inside the heat, making the effect even worse). The idea of dynamically changing the glass to reduce heat stays the same, but we would want a reflective surface rather than a dark surface.Â And while I&rsquo;m making updates based on physics, let&rsquo;s put a one-way release valve near the top of the car so that convection can push warm air out of the vehicle!</p>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/food-trucks-are-restaurants-version-of-a-lean-startup/">Food trucks are restaurant&#8217;s version of a lean startup</a></h1>
      <p>Austin is boomtown for food trucks. They&rsquo;re everywhere! For example, the trailer-food park on South 1st (<a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/south-austin-trailer-park-and-eatery-austin">http://www.yelp.com/biz/south-austin-trailer-park-and-eatery-austin</a>).Â There are too many great food trucks around town to name, but a couple of my favorites are Sushi-A-Go-Go and Gourdough&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>Anyway, after a recent outing where I sat at aÂ kitschyÂ picnic table in the summer heat eating trailer food, it struck me that food trucks are restaurant&rsquo;s version of a lean startup. Just as the cost of starting a software business went down with the commoditization of hardware and bandwidth, we&rsquo;re seeing an explosion of restaurants thanks to greatly reduced startup and operation expenses offered by trucks/trailers/carts.Â I imagine that by using a truck/trailer/cart, the business owner saves a ton of money; I&rsquo;d guess there are significant savings on electricity (heating and cooling, lighting), service (less area to maintain, fewer waiters necessary), and rent. How cool is that?!</p>

<p>The truck/cart/stand is the proving ground. Those who are happy with their situation are free to keep doing what they&rsquo;re doing, or they can move easily (thanks to the mobility of the restaurant).Â Business owners who choose to expand can move to a more permanent home in a brick-and-mortar store. A few Austin examples includeÂ Franklin&rsquo;s BBQ, Man Bites Dog, and Torchy&rsquo;s Tacos.</p>

<p>Overall, I think it&rsquo;s a great trend! As the options increase, food quality goes up and prices go down. And don&rsquo;t tell anyone, but I have a little dream of opening Austin&rsquo;s first decent ramen restaurant&hellip;</p>

<p>What do you think? Do you like the trend? Does my analogy make sense? What food trucks/trailers/carts do you like? What are we missing?</p>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/cmo-chief-morale-officer/">CMO - Chief Morale Officer</a></h1>
      <p>Companies should create a Chief Morale Officer (CMO) whose sole job is to improve the situation for the company&rsquo;s employees. I believe that morale is equally important as other C-level positions (accounting/finance, strategy/vision, or technology) so it should be treated with similar respect.</p>

<p><a title="Wikipedia: Knowledge Worker Productivity" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_work_productivity" target="_blank">Knowledge worker productivity</a> is very important. We&rsquo;re seeing renewed interest in the area and a few neat studies, such as this one using <a title="Arxiv MT and productivity" href="http://www.technologyreview.com/blog/arxiv/25636/">Mechanical Turk</a>. Dan Pink gave a <a title="TED: Dan Pink on Motivation" href="http://www.ted.com/talks/dan_pink_on_motivation.html" target="_blank">great TED talk</a> on the subject in which he declares that workers need three things: mastery, autonomy, and purpose.Â I firmly believe that morale is the X-factor that leads to continuing success for companies.</p>

<p>Google and Apple have employees that are proud, motivated, and happy. And these people continue to produce amazing products. Many acquisitions are done in hopes of gaining the best and brightest people, but as soon as these people join the new company, their morale drops and their ideas dry up. A happy worker is a productive worker; they bring ideas, energy, enthusiasm, care and concern. An unhappy programmer may hammer out 100 lines of undocumented, uncreative code a day, while a happy programmer would write 200 lines of well documented, elegant code with tests. Being happy removes distractions and helps you find your flow.</p>

<p>As we move more and more towards a service economy, many jobs cannot be done by unhappy people. Happy people are better at service.Â <a title="Alain de Botton on the Pleasures and Sorrows of Work" href="http://www.econtalk.org/archives/2010/09/de_botton_on_th.html">Humans can be thought of as complex machines</a>. If you&rsquo;re going to acquire a complex machine, take care of it. You should not break your complex tools or your business fails. Overall, businesses should be getting nicer, although I&rsquo;m not sure that&rsquo;s true.</p>

<p>Companies should create a Chief Morale Officer (CMO) whose sole job is to improve the situation for the company&rsquo;s employees. Make work fun and reap the rewards!</p>

      <p><strong>Note: I started writing this post and it got long, really fast. I&rsquo;m going to publish what I have and worry about tuning it up later&hellip;</strong></p>

<p>I believe that everyone can and should learn how to make a simple, static website. There are billions of websites and our lives increasingly involve the web (a nice side effect: there are a lot of jobs in the area). What do you need to begin? A text editor and a web browser. Now you&rsquo;re on your way to creating webpages with HTML/CSS!</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR</strong></p>

<p>Open a text editor, type or copy/paste in &lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;title&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;body&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;, save the file as index.html, fire up a web browser, and open the file. You&rsquo;ve just created a webpage!</p>

<p><strong>Full</strong></p>

<p>HTML - the structure:</p>

<ul>
<li><a title="Wikipedia - HTML" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">Wikipedia - HTML</a></li>
<li><a title="W3C - HTML specification" href="http://www.w3.org/html/">W3C - HTML specification</a></li>
<li><a title="W3C - HTML training" href="http://www.w3.org/wiki/HTML/Training">W3C - HTML training materials</a></li>
</ul>


<p>CSS - the style:</p>

<ul>
<li><a title="Wikipedia - CSS" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets">Wikipedia - CSS</a></li>
<li><a title="W3C - CSS" href="http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/">W3C - CSS specification</a></li>
<li><a title="W3C - CSS training" href="http://www.w3.org/wiki/CSS/Training">W3C - CSS training materials</a></li>
</ul>


<p>Text editors: (NOTE: a platform is another way of saying operating system like Mac OS X, Windows XP/Vista/7, etc)</p>

<ul>
<li>Notepad (Windows only, built-in, free)</li>
<li>Wordpad (Windows only, built-in to, free)</li>
<li>TextEdit (Mac only, built-in, free)</li>
<li>gedit (Linux only, built-in to Ubuntu, free)</li>
<li><a title="Notepad++" href="http://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a> (all platforms, downloadable, free)</li>
<li><a title="Macromates - TextMate" href="http://macromates.com/">TextMate</a> (Mac only, downloadable, ~$58)</li>
<li><a title="Eclipse" href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a> (all platforms, downloadable, free)</li>
<li><a title="jEdit" href="http://www.jedit.org/">jEdit</a> (Linux only, downloadable, free).</li>
<li>In a pinch, Microsoft Word or another word processor will work, but these are suboptimal.</li>
<li>You could also learn Vim, emacs, nano, pico, or a number of others, but I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re as user-friendly&ndash;their power comes from features that a designer probably won&rsquo;t need.</li>
</ul>


<p>Web browsers:</p>

<ul>
<li><a title="Google Chrome" href="http://www.google.com/chrome/">Google Chrome</a> (all platforms, downloadable, free) - my favorite for speed and built-in tools</li>
<li><a title="Mozilla Firefox" href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/new/">Mozilla Firefox</a> (all platforms, downloadable, free) - my favorite for extensibility</li>
<li><a title="Apple Safari" href="http://www.apple.com/safari/">Apple Safari</a> (Mac/Windows, built-in/downloadable, free)</li>
<li>Microsoft Internet Explorer (Windows only, built-in,Â free) - the most popular browser on the web</li>
<li>There are other web browsers, but they do not have significant market share.</li>
</ul>


<p>I would recommend you start with a concrete task, like creating an &ldquo;About me&rdquo; page that explains who you are and what you&rsquo;re doing.Â Here&rsquo;s a simple HTML program that you can copy and paste into your text editor, save as index.html, and open in a web browser.</p>

<pre>&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;
      Title
    &lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    Body
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</pre>


<p>Now, extend your simple page. Here are a few recommended tasks:</p>

<ul>
<li>use a new HTML element like a section heading (&lt;h1&gt;&hellip;&lt;/h1&gt;), a link (&lt;a href=&ldquo;&rdquo;&gt;&hellip;&lt;/a&gt;), or a paragraph (&lt;p&gt;&hellip;&lt;/p&gt;)</li>
<li>create and link to an external style file</li>
<li>change the font</li>
<li>change the font color</li>
<li>add an image</li>
<li>change the background color</li>
<li>create a content box that is centered on the page (hint: set width and margins)</li>
</ul>


<p>From here, the sky is the limit! You can create HTML emails, partner with those who do not know how (or are too busy) to make websites, improve the usability of sites for anyone who will let you (for example, non-profits and local favorites).</p>

<p>Anytime you see a webpage you like, simply right click on the background and view the source. The Safari and Chrome inspectors are particularly nice for seeing how the markup and style are interacting.</p>

<p>More advanced topics include SEO, creating your own graphics, further reading, and JavaScript. I&rsquo;ll provide a few links about each below.</p>

<p>HTML/CSS advanced topics:</p>

<ul>
<li>Pseudo elements</li>
<li>Selectors</li>
<li>CSS3 animations, transitions</li>
<li>HTML5 controls like audio and video</li>
</ul>


<p>JavaScript</p>

<ul>
<li>JavaScript</li>
<li>Choose a framework like jQuery, Dojo, or ExtJS</li>
</ul>


<p>Search engine optimization (SEO) - where your page appears on Google (and other search engines) is tied to your content as well how you structure and style it. Knowing the basics of SEO will let you create pages that will appear higher in search engine results.</p>

<ul>
<li><a title="Wikipedia: Search Engine Optimization" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization">Wikipedia - SEO</a> - high-level overview</li>
<li><a title="Google SEO starter guide" href="http://www.google.com/webmasters/docs/search-engine-optimization-starter-guide.pdf">Google Search Engine Optimization Starter Guide</a> - the search engine to get ranked</li>
<li><a title="SEOmoz beginners guide to SEO" href="http://www.seomoz.org/beginners-guide-to-seo">SEOmoz beginners guide</a> - another great introductory read</li>
<li><a title="Alexa" href="http://www.alexa.com/">Alexa</a> - see traffic amounts and webpage information</li>
</ul>


<p>Accessibility - related to SEO is accessibility. If you create your markup properly, your content will be &ldquo;readable&rdquo; by people with disabilities. Luckily, Google reads your site very similar to the tools utilized by people with disabilities, so making your site more accessible means your site will rank higher on search engines.</p>

<p>Use free UI packs</p>

<p>Create your own graphics -</p>

<ul>
<li>Adobe Photoshop and Photoshop Express</li>
<li>Adobe Illustrator</li>
<li>GIMP</li>
<li>Inkscape</li>
<li>Pixelmator</li>
<li>Microsoft PowerPoint</li>
<li>Microsoft Paint</li>
<li>Apple Preview</li>
</ul>


<p>Tools and resources</p>

<ul>
<li><a title="Stack Overflow" href="http://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a></li>
<li>Firefox addon - Firebug</li>
</ul>


<p>Version control</p>

      <p>I love Google Reader! I love the format for finding, reading, and sharing news. I also enjoy Google+, but I find that I&rsquo;d like to discuss Google Reader items more on Google+. Until now, I could not find a way to do so.

<p>Has anyone else figured out a better way?</p>
