      <h1 class="link"><a href="/mmorpgs/">MMORPGs</a></h1>
      <p>MMORPGs have been on my mind recently. Yesterday I was talking to a co-worker who is a hardcore gamer: he played three accounts at once in EQ, he plays two in WoW, he has every console, etc. It occurred to me that one reason he likes the games is because he plays an entire group by himself, so the entire game is open to him.</p>

<p>WoW has terrible soloability; solo quests and PvE are mindless, I mean it can be automated pretty easily (I would know :-o). However, there&rsquo;s no way you can solo any dungeon until you&rsquo;re 20+ levels above it, and all end game content requires at least one other person (PvP arenas) and up to 39 others (40 man raids). I personally do not want to join a random guild with random people; I don&rsquo;t want to have to try to make friends in MMOs&mdash;I want to play by myself, anytime, or with my friends. In Ultima Online friends seemed to come more naturally, and you could solo almost everything so the entire game was accessible. DAoC gave group bonuses so it was beneficial to group with anyone you could find.</p>

<p>Another big problem I have with WoW is the fact that the game revolves entirely around gear. The best gear wins everytime. The best gear is a pain to get (long, hard quests or massive dungeon runs with virtually no chance of getting the drop). The difficulty of getting gear inherently favors the hardcore and leads to another nasty feature: soulbound items. Soulbound has at least two negative effects:</p>

<p>1), you cannot trade/sell gear which hurts the economy and is unfair to users with multiple characters&mdash;you can&rsquo;t even trade your own items to yourself!</p>

<p>2) people with the best gear will always have the best gear&mdash;there&rsquo;s no way to lose it; armor&rsquo;s broken, repair, done. In UO items were easy-come, easy-go which made for a much more casual feel and required much less time. UO also lowered the gap between a hoss in the best gear with perfect skills and a newbie with starter gear and no skills; everyone was competitive and could have fun. The point of this gargantuan post is that MMORPGs are not out of the casual gamers reach; we simply need the right game (with high soloability and little reliance on gear/level). I hope a game satisfying these requirements will come out soon although I doubt I&rsquo;ll play.</p>

      <p>Where&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s a will, there&rsquo;s a way. And likely, if there&rsquo;s a will, there&rsquo;s money. We&rsquo;ve all felt the effects of spam in our email, but some of you may have never seen the amount of spam posted to blogs. Once a day I have to moderate comments with content similar to that of spam email. While that may not sound like much, I am grossly understating the achievement of finding my blog. Try googling for &ldquo;<a title="google for blog" href="http://www.google.com/search?q=blog" target="_blank">blog</a>&rdquo; and you will not find my site easily.</p>

<p>The level of sophistication necessary to post spam on blogs is very high: <a title="google for seth holloway blog and you still may not find me" href="http://www.google.com/search?q=seth+holloway+blog" target="_blank">find a blog</a>, find a post, click to comment, paste in the spam, click to add the comments, and repeat. Anyone with the skills to do so could be gainfully employed as a programmer. What does it say that some would choose to be spammers instead? Hmmm&hellip;</p>

<p>Truth be told, a lot of spam is created by <a title="wikipedia article -- feed your brain" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Script_kiddies" target="_blank">script kiddies</a> who download an easy-to-use hacking kit and start doing their thing. There&rsquo;s something inherently strange about trusting a stranger to furnish tools specifically for illegal, or at least maligned, activity. For example, <a title="netcraft article on phishing fraud" href="http://news.netcraft.com/archives/2008/01/22/mrbrain_stealing_phish_from_fraudsters.html" target="_blank">this story</a> gives details on how a hacking group released a phishing kit that benefits the original group as much as the script kiddie using the package.</p>

<p>Spam is not going away until we make it unprofitable. Although it is hard to stop, please do the world a favor and stop buying all those penis pills you heard about from the stranger online.</p>

<p>UPDATE: This post was more about my continuing amazement with nefarious people, but <a href="http://www.laneholloway.com" target="_blank">Lane</a> informed me of the <a href="http://akismet.com/" target="_blank">Akismet</a> plugin to fight comment spam which the nice folks at <a href="http://www.wordpress.org" target="_blank">Wordpress</a> talk about <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Combating_Comment_Spam" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>Apparently GUI automation tools are so easy to use that any decent programmer can develop a script to post spam arbitrarily. Very clever. Very cool. Luckily, the counter measure to comment-spam is equally elegant.</p>

<p>Ahhh, and a good chuckle because the first comment on this post was spam&hellip;</p>

      <p>We&rsquo;ve all felt the crunch of deadlines and work piling up,  as we balance the working world and the life we&rsquo;re meant to live. In this busy, always-on environment, I am a big fan of getting things done. I am also open to suggestions. In an effort to improve my productivity I went to the &ldquo;experts&rdquo; that I found online, namely <a title="lifehack - waste time mining for precious little gold" href="http://www.lifehack.org/" target="_blank">lifehack</a>&mdash;a website touting useful resources in personal productivity. However, the official <a title="do not waste your time by checking the lifehack blog =)" href="http://www.sethholloway.com/blog/">lifehack blog</a> fills with overblown, verbose posts like <a title="zzz" href="http://www.lifehack.org/articles/lifehack/big-blokes-in-skirts.html" target="_blank">this one</a> that took me minutes to read and essentially said&hellip; well, nothing.</p>

<p>I prefer the minimalistic approach of <a title="say it in five sentences" href="http://five.sentenc.es/"><a href="http://five.sentenc.es">http://five.sentenc.es</a></a> who practice what they preach. We as information consumers should not support these modern-day Dickens who write like they&rsquo;re paid by the word. Even worse are the wolves-in-sheep-clothing producers who waste your time instead of improving your efficiency. In the interest of not wasting your time, I&rsquo;m done with this rant now.</p>

      <p>I was just cleaning the apartment and I realized that my simple life is full of clutter&mdash;every week I pick up the same few items and throw them away. Among the offenders are</p>

<ul>
<li>Plastic bags (groceries)</li>
<li>Plastic water bottles</li>
<li>Magazines</li>
<li>Junk mail</li>
</ul>


<p>Most of those can be recycled&hellip; somewhere, somehow&hellip; Unfortunately, I do not have any convenient way of disposing of these items in a more environmentally-friendly way (and as much as I care about the environment, I don&rsquo;t want to store boxes of stuff, find the drop-off locations, and then make multiple separate trips). I&rsquo;ve been searching (reading and brainstorming) for clever ways to use these items, but I have not found much. <a title="tips to improve your life, or waste your time" href="http://www.lifehack.org/">Lifehack</a> had an article on <a title="10 ways to reuse plastic bags" href="http://www.lifehack.org/articles/lifehack/10-uses-for-plastic-grocery-bags.html" target="_blank">10 ways to reuse plastic bags</a>.

      <p>My father once told me that I should reply, &ldquo;Unbelievable!&rdquo; anytime someone queried about my mood. The logic behind this was simple: the definition of &ldquo;unbelievable&rdquo; can fit any situation and people interpret the response positively. In general, people like to be around fun, positive people, so your &ldquo;unbelievable&rdquo; reply starts you off on the right foot.</p>

<p>Today, like most days, I&rsquo;m unbelievable, and I hope you are too!</p>

      <p>The joke goes that 98% of people consider themselves good drivers. Driving is such a tangible effort: everyone over the age of 16 can drive. Because that captures such a large percentage of the population, there are a number of ideas about how to drive. As I see it, traffic laws should be obeyed in spirit rather than completely literally.</p>

<p>Basic driving rules:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Keep right!</strong> If someone is going slower than you would like to go, pass them on the left and return to the right</li>
<li><strong>Do not drive on the heel of another car!</strong> This goes with number 1 but represents a separate idea to which attention should be paid. do not hover behind a nearby vehicle: it is obnoxious to anyone trying to pass and it is dangerous because you may be in someone&rsquo;s blind spot.</li>
<li><strong>Know the speed limit at all times!</strong> Going under the speed limit hurts both you and others on the road. the government chooses a speed limit based on safety concerns and the average speed observed in an area. do not try to circumvent the law and drive at a lower speed&mdash;they&rsquo;ve already set the lower limit for you. Going less than speed limit increases your commute time and likely increases the amount of gasoline wasted on idling. By driving slowly you are also slowing the general flow of traffic so your decision triggers a loss of time for everyone around you.</li>
<li><strong>Travel at the speed limit to 7mph over speed limit at all times!</strong> In addition to knowing the speed limit, driving at 0-7 mph over the speed limit insulates you from 95% of speeding tickets and gets you places faster. Some basic calculations. One ticket a year costs an average of $100 ($50 administrative + $50 for defensive driving). If you are paid $20 an hour, the ticket is worthwhile if you can save 5 hours of time a year from driving. If you drive an average of 20 miles a day, 300 days a year, then you drive 6000 miles a year. with an average posted speed limit of 45mph, driving an average of 47mph will save 5.67 hours over the course of a year without appreciably increasing your chances to get a ticket. Driving the extra 2mph is clearly worth your effort.</li>
<li><strong>Get happy!</strong> Leave the road rage at home. If you accomplish this, please tell me how!</li>
</ul>


<p>The other day <a title="Andrea Mire Holloway home" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andreamholloway">Andrea</a> pointed out a disturbing trend: people driving with earphones in (<em>cough iPod cough</em>). Initially, I agreed without much thought; however, she went on to say that the disturbing part is that even people with nice cars are doing it. After she pointed it out, I&rsquo;ve seen people in all kinds of cars from Fords to Mercedez throwing caution to the wind and driving with deafening music pumping directly into their eardrums. As a corollary, not a full rule, listen to music through your cars radio!</p>

<p>I imagine I&rsquo;m missing some other rules, but I think this is a good start.</p>

      <p>Are you an application developer? Do not do write applications that steal focus (i.e. if your email client pops up without you attempting to open the program). That was standard in 1998, but not in 2008. Like viral ads, applications that steal focus have no place in today&rsquo;s world: they pollute the landscape and disrupt workflows.</p>

      <p>Being a researcher and techie myself, I have seen my fair share of technologies that will change the world and innovation that will never leave the lab.</p>

<p>I once read that the easiest was to reduce your daily stress is to shorten your commute. Everyone is annoyed while driving, but we cannot easily reduce our reliance on cars. I know that innovations are attainable with our current technology, so why has no one introduced changes to our roadways and vehicles? Are the technologies too expensive? Or is something more sinister at hand?</p>

<p>In this always-on world people long to be connected at all times; the commute is an inevitable impediment to staying connected and therefor causes us stress. Driving gets us from point A to point B: from one place we need or want to be to another. The journey is merely the time between now and then and is rarely pleasurable.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve found that riding my bike is a great way to get from A to B while simultaneously exercising, clearing my head, and waking up. However, biking is not always possible or practical. This is where we have a major opportunity to improve life with technology; whether that is car driving themselves or the back of the car in front of us has a display on it (for our enjoyment), there are so many good ideas that could make the driving public happier.</p>

      <p>I wrote earlier about <a title="dogs in public" href="http://sethholloway.com/blog/?p=4">dogs in public</a> and <a title="cell phones in public" href="http://sethholloway.com/blog/?p=5">cell phones in public</a> which leads me to wonder what social dynamics will emerge as we continue to integrate technology into our lives. Given what I&rsquo;ve seen, it seems that people are increasingly averse to face-to-face interactions. Between iPods, cell phones, and pets, people can live an entire day in public without interacting with another person directly. This seems to fly in the face of housing trends. America recently passed an important point in her history: we have over 50% of the population in urban areas and the majority of America&rsquo;s big cities only continue to grow. Are we as a nation experiencing growing pains as more people are forced into crowded spaces? Are Europeans, who have handled urban living for decades ahead of us, as aloof and passive as Americans? Anecdotally, the answer is no. It is a brave new world.</p>

<p>Sociologists are also interested in the effect of  technology on society. As described in <a title="Family Ties" href="http://www.economist.com/specialreports/displaystory.cfm?story_id=10950449" target="_blank">this article from the Economist.com</a>, researchers have been pessimistic about changes in technology for years. I trust the human spirit to persevere; like Celine Dion, my heart will go on.</p>
