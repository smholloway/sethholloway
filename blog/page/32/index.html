      <p>Last night we went to <a title="Homepage currently down :-\" href="http://www.midorisushiaustin.com/" target="_blank">Midori</a>, a sushi/Asian food restaurant in NW Austin. <a title="Only website you need...EVAR" href="http://www.laneholloway.com" target="_blank">Lane</a> went here for his birthday meal and liked it. I was really excited after I read the <a title="Yelp: Midori" href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/midori-sushi-austin" target="_blank">overwhelmingly positive reviews</a>. Even the local Fox affiliates foodie, <a title="Rob Balon on Midori" href="http://www.diningoutwithrobbalon.com/review/midori/" target="_blank">Rob Balon, loved it</a>!</p>

<p>After eating there I must say that I was impressed. Everything was absolutely delicious! The miso was a treat; the house salad was fresh and satisfying; the teriyaki was superb; and the sushi was fantastic. I recommend the Boca Raton roll which is similar to Maru&rsquo;s J-Bomb, but way less spicy.</p>

<p>Beyond great food the place has ambience. The interior is very clean; the restaurant is decorated with Japanese-looking pieces. Waitresses wear traditional Japanese garb and the sushi chefs welcome you with a Japanese &ldquo;hello&rdquo;&mdash;I&rsquo;ve been watching anime long enough to know some Japanese! Fun.</p>

<p>I will be returning to Midori!</p>

      <p>This morning I was inspired by a speech from <a title="wikipedia: Dave Eggers" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Eggers" target="_blank">Dave Eggers</a>, one of three 2008 TED prize ($100,000) winners. In <a title="Dave Eggers in 4 minutes on TED" href="http://blog.ted.com/2008/10/dave_eggers_in.php" target="_blank">this clip</a> Dave talks about how we, the people, can help the educational system. The idea is simple:</p>

<object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="425" height="344" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/l3QbzvT6vko&amp;color1=0xb1b1b1&amp;color2=0xcfcfcf&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="344" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/l3QbzvT6vko&amp;color1=0xb1b1b1&amp;color2=0xcfcfcf&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object>


<p>As you&rsquo;ll see in the video, Austin has a similar center called the <a title="Austin Bat Cave" href="http://www.austinbatcave.org/Home.html" target="_blank">Austin Bat Cave</a>. (Apparently it&rsquo;s not officially <a title="wikipedia: 826 National" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/826_National" target="_blank">826 National</a>, but it follows in the same vein.)</p>

<p>I think Dave has an excellent, inspirational idea that should be replicated all over. Anyone interested in starting the central Austin center?</p>

      <p>Today I heard about a neat new web app: <a title="SUMO Paint" href="http://www.sumo.fi/products/sumopaint/" target="_blank">SUMO Paint</a>. It&rsquo;s no Photoshop (or Inkscape if you like free!), but the features are pretty solid and it provides a lot of options for importing/exporting.</p>

<p>SUMO Paint represents a big advancement in online capabilities. We&rsquo;ll soon be able to do everything online&mdash;&ldquo;in the cloud&rdquo;&mdash;from any computer with an Internet connection. Cool!</p>

<li>Another about Palin&rsquo;s incompetency: She may not even be <a title="Palin does not know about government" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqBUbHsr070" target="_blank">smarter than a 3rd grader</a>.</li>
<li>And onto the financial crisis which is showing few signs of letting up. This could be because <a title="Fire the banks" href="http://firedoglake.com/2008/10/25/banks-we-have-better-things-to-do-with-that-money-you-gave-us-than-lend-it-out/" target="_blank">banks have better things to do with their free money</a> than lend it to Joe Sixpack.

      <p>What do elephants, humans, and bacteria have in common? Probably a lot, but the answer I&rsquo;m looking for is the amount of energy we use. Scientists have found that <a title="Wired article" href="http://blog.wired.com/wiredscience/2008/10/scientists-comp.html" target="_blank">all living things use roughly the same amount of energy</a>. It seems this study contradicts earlier research. I&rsquo;m interested to find out more, especially after reporting on <a title="Seth Holloway dot com: Tardigrade" href="http://sethholloway.com/blog/?p=103" target="_blank">Tardigrade </a>that can survive all kinds of crazy conditions. Even humans seem to burn different amount of energy (think of the skinny guy who can eat anything), although I doubt that&rsquo;s an order of magnitude different among species.</p>

      <p>A McCain volunteer claimed <a title="Fake assault" href="http://kdka.com/local/attack.McCain.Bloomfield.2.847628.html" target="_blank">a large black man assaulted her</a>; however, it seems that was not the case. I am particularly amused that she claimed the assailant had and carved a &ldquo;B&rdquo; in her face. The only problem: the B was backwards as if done in a mirror. The <a title="McCain is desperate" href="http://tpmelectioncentral.talkingpointsmemo.com/2008/10/mccain_aide_gave_reporters_inc.php" target="_blank">McCain campaign capitalized on the story</a> and tried to rile people up by making race an issue.</p>

<p>Apparently it is on people&rsquo;s minds as NPR had interviews playing last night where some folks revealed that they were afraid of the racial tensions that would explode if 1) a black man was elected or 2) if a black man had gotten this far and then was not elected.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m left wondering if the girl did this as part of an official plan by the McCain camp. Is she representative of modern conservatives? In any case, she&rsquo;s a sick, sad person and the McCain campaign further smacks of desperation.</p>

      <p>The government has meddled far too long by regulating the electromagnetic spectrum!

      <p>Back in the day I dabbled with video game automation. In fact, it was the subject of my senior design project. I started macroing (playing unattended) in the first MMORPG I ever played, Ultima Online. There have been bots for every game since. Some bots are specific while others are more generalized. I&rsquo;ve played around with system automation software and specific programs.</p>

<p>By far the most sophisticated I&rsquo;ve seen was designed for World of Warcraft (WoW). WoWGlider, or just Glider, as it was called provided functionality for virtually everything in the game. The really savvy guys combined their own homegrown programs, addons, and Glider to gain lots of money and levels. These virtual goods are worth a ton. And game makers pretend to hate it. Botters get can get disconnected, killed, have their items stripped, and worst, banned (i.e. the account is deleted).</p>

<p>But the most aggressive actions were taken by Blizzard, maker of some of the most popular games ever (Diablo I &amp; II, Starcraft, Warcraft 1-3). I suppose the sophistication of Glider warranted special care, so Blizzard filed suit against MDY, the maker of Glider. Based on a claim of copyright infringement, WoWGlider became MMOGlider, but that was not enough. Recently, MMOGlider <a title="BBC Coverage" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7645059.stm" target="_blank">lost the lawsuit</a> filed by Blizzard. If you don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s big money involved, MDY has agreed to pay $6 million in damages!</p>

<p>From my observations, MMOGlider is still running strong. Tens of people are posting a day and still making money. I&rsquo;m interested to see how this plays out because of the implications to copyright infringement and what we&rsquo;re allowed to do in virtual worlds.</p>
