      <p><b>The Clifton StrengthsFinder</b></p>

<p>Strengths as determined by a survey from the &ldquo;<a title="Now, Discover Your Strengths on Amazon" href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0743201140/">Now, Discover Your Strengths</a>&rdquo; book.</p>

<p>Below are my top five themes of talent, ranked in the order revealed by my responses to the <a title="Strengths Finder" href="http://www.strengthsfinder.com">Clifton StrengthsFinder</a>.</p>

<p>As you may know, the Clifton StrengthsFinder measures the presence of talent in 34 categories called &ldquo;themes.&rdquo; These themes were determined by The Gallup Organization as those that most consistently predict outstanding performance. The greater the presence of a theme of talent within a person, the more likely that person is to spontaneously exhibit those talents in day-to-day behaviors.</p>

<p>Focusing on naturally powerful talents helps people use them as the foundation of strengths and enjoy personal, academic, and career success through consistent, near-perfect performance.</p>

<div><b>Learner</b></div>


<p>You love to learn. The subject matter that interests you most will be determined by your other themes and experiences, but whatever the subject, you will always be drawn to the process of learning. The process, more than the content or the result, is especially exciting for you. You are energized by the steady and deliberate journey from ignorance to competence. The thrill of the first few facts, the early efforts to recite or practice what you have learned, the growing confidence of a skill mastered—this is the process that entices you. Your excitement leads you to engage in adult learning experiences—yoga or piano lessons or graduate classes. It enables you to thrive in dynamic work environments where you are asked to take on short project assignments and are expected to learn a lot about the new subject matter in a short period of time and then move on to the next one. This Learner theme does not necessarily mean that you seek to become the subject matter expert, or that you are striving for the respect that accompanies a professional or academic credential. The outcome of the learning is less significant than the “getting there.”</p>

<div><b>Achiever</b></div>


<p>Your Achiever theme helps explain your drive. Achiever describes a constant need for achievement. You feel as if every day starts at zero. By the end of the day you must achieve something tangible in order to feel good about yourself. And by “every day” you mean every single day—workdays, weekends, vacations. No matter how much you may feel you deserve a day of rest, if the day passes without some form of achievement, no matter how small, you will feel dissatisfied. You have an internal fire burning inside you. It pushes you to do more, to achieve more. After each accomplishment is reached, the fire dwindles for a moment, but very soon it rekindles itself, forcing you toward the next accomplishment. Your relentless need for achievement might not be logical. It might not even be focused. But it will always be with you. As an Achiever you must learn to live with this whisper of discontent. It does have its benefits. It brings you the energy you need to work long hours without burning out. It is the jolt you can always count on to get you started on new tasks, new challenges. It is the power supply that causes you to set the pace and define the levels of productivity for your work group. It is the theme that keeps you moving.</p>

<div><b>Input</b></div>


<p>You are inquisitive. You collect things. You might collect information—words, facts, books, and quotations—or you might collect tangible objects such as butterflies, baseball cards, porcelain dolls, or sepia photographs. Whatever you collect, you collect it because it interests you. And yours is the kind of mind that finds so many things interesting. The world is exciting precisely because of its infinite variety and complexity. If you read a great deal, it is not necessarily to refine your theories but, rather, to add more information to your archives. If you like to travel, it is because each new location offers novel artifacts and facts. These can be acquired and then stored away. Why are they worth storing? At the time of storing it is often hard to say exactly when or why you might need them, but who knows when they might become useful? With all those possible uses in mind, you really don’t feel comfortable throwing anything away. So you keep acquiring and compiling and filing stuff away. It’s interesting. It keeps your mind fresh. And perhaps one day some of it will prove valuable.</p>

<div><b>Restorative</b></div>


<p>You love to solve problems. Whereas some are dismayed when they encounter yet another breakdown, you can be energized by it. You enjoy the challenge of analyzing the symptoms, identifying what is wrong, and finding the solution. You may prefer practical problems or conceptual ones or personal ones. You may seek out specific kinds of problems that you have met many times before and that you are confident you can fix. Or you may feel the greatest push when faced with complex and unfamiliar problems. Your exact preferences are determined by your other themes and experiences. But what is certain is that you enjoy bringing things back to life. It is a wonderful feeling to identify the undermining factor(s), eradicate them, and restore something to its true glory. Intuitively, you know that without your intervention, this thing—this machine, this technique, this person, this company—might have ceased to function. You fixed it, resuscitated it, rekindled its vitality. Phrasing it the way you might, you saved it.</p>

<div><b>Individualization</b></div>


<p>Your Individualization theme leads you to be intrigued by the unique qualities of each person. You are impatient with generalizations or “types” because you don’t want to obscure what is special and distinct about each person. Instead, you focus on the differences between individuals. You instinctively observe each person’s style, each person’s motivation, how each thinks, and how each builds relationships. You hear the one-of-a-kind stories in each person’s life. This theme explains why you pick your friends just the right birthday gift, why you know that one person prefers praise in public and another detests it, and why you tailor your teaching style to accommodate one person’s need to be shown and another’s desire to “figure it out as I go.” Because you are such a keen observer of other people’s strengths, you can draw out the best in each person. This Individualization theme also helps you build productive teams. While some search around for the perfect team “structure” or “process,” you know instinctively that the secret to great teams is casting by individual strengths so that everyone can do a lot of what they do well.</p>

<p>How well do you think these themes describe me?</p>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/individuals-create-committees-critique/">Individuals create; committees critique</a></h1>
      <p>&ldquo;Individuals create; committees critique.&rdquo; Years ago a mentor, Rick Scott, helped me get unstuck with these simple words. Rick solidified the lesson with a story: to create the <a title="Declaration of Independence" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Declaration_of_Independence">Declaration of Independence</a>, the <a title="Committee of Five" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committee_of_Five">Committee of Five</a> had Thomas Jefferson write the first draft, which the group then edited and pushed through Congress. The founding fathers knew they would not make the necessary progress if they worked through every detail together.</p>

<p>To apply this to your own life and be more effective, realize that groups are better suited at critiquing than creating, so it&rsquo;s on you to prototype something, then ask for feedback and build consensus.</p>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/search-has-to-solve-versioning/">Search has to solve versioning</a></h1>
      <p>Search has been failing me frequently in the recent past, and the problem is only getting worse. Versions are everywhere and search is not keeping up. Here are a few examples:</p>

<ul>
<li>Googling for &ldquo;mac lion&rdquo; returns 5 results for Lion and 5 for Mountain Lion on the first page. Specifying version number (e.g., &ldquo;mac lion 10.7&rdquo;) or date (e.g., &ldquo;mac lion 2011&rdquo;) does not particularly help the results.</li>
<li>World of Warcraft has repeated some items with each expansion (or retooled bosses like Onyxia and even whole zones like Naxxramus). Searching for the item may lead you to the 2010 incarnation. Simply adding 2012 or the expansion name is often ineffective because the pages will contain dates and expansion names throughout the content. Another example: there are over <a title="Fortune Card -- what version???" href="http://www.wowhead.com/item=60840/fortune-card">50 virtually identical fortune cards</a>.</li>
<li>A similar idea occurs in GitHub branches. For example, if you&rsquo;re looking for <a title="Toopher Ruby" href="https://github.com/toopher/toopher-ruby">Toopher&rsquo;s Ruby client</a> (which rocks!) then you might find my fork that was already merged with master.</li>
<li>In my personalized search results for &ldquo;cross platform password management,&rdquo; Google returns an outdated <a title="Outdated -- Lifehacker's five best password managers" href="http://lifehacker.com/5042616/five-best-password-managers">Lifehacker article from 2008</a> above more recent articles. In this case, recency trumps Lifehacker&rsquo;s relevance and authority.</li>
<li>While learning Clojure (at version 1.4) I kept finding StackOverflow responses like, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s how to do it in Clojure 1.2.&rdquo; The more dangerous response was &ldquo;here&rsquo;s how to do it in Clojure&rdquo; with no mention of versioning. I spent hours trying to get the outdated procedures to work only to have them fail.</li>
<li>There are bugs that exist for certain operating systems with certain versions of dependent projects. Like <a title="Ruby 1.9.2 seg faults with OpenSSL" href="http://www.christopherirish.com/2011/09/02/ruby-1-9-2-segmentation-fault-and-openssl/">Ruby 1.9.2+ on Mac OS X Lion when installed with RVM 1.0 or higher</a>. Searching for this was difficult because it required so many versions.</li>
</ul>


<p>Some of these examples would be prevented by using advanced search options and narrowing results to the past year; however, I feel that&rsquo;s a cop-out for a poor user experience.</p>

<p>Until search engines gain additional processing, I think we should get familiar with scoping search results and ask that answers contain version information for increased searchability.</p>

<p>I think search has to solve versioning&mdash;what do you think?</p>

      <p>Over the years I have played with a few different resume styles. I had the <a title="Seth Holloway's outdated LaTeX resume" href="https://github.com/smholloway/resume/tree/master/latex">LaTeX template</a>, the <a title="Seth Holloway's timeline resume" href="http://www.sethholloway.com/timelineResume.html">timeline resume</a>, the <a title="Seth Holloway's responsive design resume" href="http://www.sethholloway.com/resume.html">responsive resume</a> (resize your browser or check it out on your phone), and the old school World of Warcraft character builder style resume. This post is meant to showcase the RPG character builder resume that I never publicized. Check it out:</p>

<p>If the screenshot leaves you wanting, you can see my <a title="Seth Holloway RPG Character Builder Resume" href="http://sethholloway.com/alternativeResume.html">RPG style resume live</a> and check out <a title="WoW character builder" href="http://wowtal.com/#k=ff-.bqj.druid.">World of Warcraft Character Builder</a> for the inspiration.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve also <a title="Seth Holloway's resumes on GitHub " href="https://github.com/smholloway/resume">open sourced the resumes</a>. The individual READMEs there provide some more information about each template. I hope others will find this interesting and valuable.</p>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/lisp-and-order-of-operations-pemdas/">Lisp and order of operations (PEMDAS)</a></h1>
      <p>Somewhere around third grade I had the order of operations drilled into my head: parentheses, exponent, multiplication, division, addition, subtraction&mdash;abbreviated as PEMDAS and pronounced &ldquo;pem doss.&rdquo; PEMDAS allows you to succinctly communicate mathematical expressions.</p>

<p>5 + 3<sup>2</sup> * 7</p>

<p>Moving through PEMDAS we see there are no parentheses, but there is an exponent: 3<sup>2</sup> == 3*3 == 9. Continuing through PEMDAS we hit the M for multiplication; our example has the middle term multiplied by 7. Finally, we add 5.</p>

<p>Written in a Lisp style the same expression would look something like this:</p>

<p>(+ 5 (* 7 (pow 3 2)))</p>

<p>Rules implicitly encoded in math must be explicitly written in Lisp (or any pre- or post-fix notation for that matter). In various other languages (<a title="REPL.it is a collection of online REPLs" href="http://repl.it" target="_blank">try a few</a>) the order of operations is encoded already.</p>

<p>In a way, it is frustrating that the programming language ignores basic math rules; however, there may be benefits. I wonder, how many bugs would have been avoided by forcing people to use parentheses to group expressions? how much slower was it to type the extra keystrokes? how many future Lispers were snuffed out by explicit mathematics?</p>

<p>How do you feel about the encoding? Does pre-fix notation bother you more in another way?</p>

      <p>When I get good at something I tend to lose empathy for beginners. I&rsquo;m not unique in that regard. Reflecting on negative experiences, it was often when a senior person made me feel dumb for being new. This happens at work, in life, even in school (how many college profs answer questions gracefully?).</p>

<p>To counteract the loss of connection, I think it is important to always be a novice at something. Said another way, always be learning.</p>

I wish I would have read this earlier, but I probably wouldn&rsquo;t have gotten much out of it because I didn&rsquo;t think I needed it. I found that the deep dives into new subjects that I frequently did during my PhD is called syntopical reading.</p>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/tv-should-be-more-interactive/">TV should be more interactive</a></h1>
      <p>TV is such a dinosaur! If I see something I want in a commercial, I have to use a second&mdash;maybe even third&mdash;device to find out more and buy it. Let&rsquo;s say I see a movie trailer and I decide I want to see the movie; currently, the onus is on me to remember. Because we have poor memories, we are inundated with the same trailer as an artificial memory aid.</p>

<p>If a movie is coming out on video, I would like to be able to add it to my Netflix queue or have a reminder to check it out on Redbox. If I see a product that I&rsquo;d like to buy, it would be nice to have a simpler method than visiting a website, calling a specified number, or both. Voting, like on American Idol, is another clear example of where TV could be more interactive.</p>

<p>Today we have Internet-enabled TVs and on-demand programs, but that&rsquo;s done little to improve the interactivity. Why have we seen disappointingly little innovation in TV?</p>
