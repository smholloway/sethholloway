      <p>According to <a title="Frank Levy" href="http://web.mit.edu/flevy/www/">Frank Levy</a>, <a title="Frank Levy's lecture at Swarthmore" href="http://web.mit.edu/flevy/www/Bernie%20Saffran%20Swarthmnore%20Lecture.pdf">the New World economy is not kind to anyone but the elite</a> (economics start on page 4). This does not bode well for the future.</p>

<p>Levy is doing very interesting research on the changing world market. I&rsquo;m particularly fond of neo-skilled labor. His research matches almost perfectly with several debates I&rsquo;ve had with other engineers&mdash;I wish I would have read the studies earlier so I could bring a different perspective.</p>

<p>I find it somewhat ironic that Dr. Levy is leading the charge into the changing global economy when he and his kin are extremely well educated (his wife is a professor at Harvard, his son is an MBA, and his daughter is a lawyer). Do the unwashed masses already know the simple truths that Dr. Levy espouses? Did academia just open the door into reality or is this truly new?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321193857/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0321193857&linkCode=as2&tag=theven01-20">The Non-Designer&rsquo;s Design Book</a> &ndash; I thought this book had great bang for the buck. Robin Williams shows how to transform boring, bad designs using CRAP&mdash;that&rsquo;s contrast, repetition, alignment, and proximity. The second edition is a bit dated; perhaps the third edition is closer to today&rsquo;s flat UI trend.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0671212095/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0671212095&linkCode=as2&tag=theven01-20">How to Read a Book: The Classic Guide to Intelligent Reading (A Touchstone book)</a> &ndash; This text asserts that there are four levels of reading: elementary (the basics), inspectional (quickly understanding the big idea), analytical (deep reading), and syntopical (thinking critically and comparing the words against all your related knowledge). I wish I would have read this earlier, but I probably wouldn&rsquo;t have gotten much out of it because I didn&rsquo;t think I needed it. I found that the deep dives into new subjects that I frequently did during my PhD is called syntopical reading.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FC11JW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B000FC11JW&linkCode=as2&tag=theven01-20">The Effective Executive (Harper business Essentials)</a> &ndash; Management guru, Peter Drucker, provides a  great guide to working on the right things. As with many business books, you could summarize it in one blog post, but then you lose the nuance. I&rsquo;m curious how Drucker would argue that a busy executive should read his entire book instead of a concise summary.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0932633161/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0932633161&linkCode=as2&tag=theven01-20">Are Your Lights On?: How to Figure Out What the Problem Really Is</a> &ndash; Another book from my productivity queue. This was a quick read with some interesting points. I was intrigued by thinking about whose problem something is and how decision makers&#8217; interests rarely align with he people experiencing the problem.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0049B1VOU/ref=as_li_ss_tl?tag=theven01-20">The Language Instinct: How The Mind Creates Language (P.S.)</a> &ndash; Reading linguistics books is dangerous when you&rsquo;re married to a linguist. Pinker tells an interesting tale, but I wasn&rsquo;t completely convinced. I found the overview of cognitive science studies absolutely brilliant.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002DOSBMK/ref=as_li_ss_tl?tag=theven01-20">Homeland: The Legend of Drizzt, Book I: Bk. 1</a> &ndash; The Drizzt series is very well reviewed, and I understand why. The lowest ratings hint at the fact that the books are pretty simple and thrive in D&amp;D lore. The book is definitely no Diamond Age or Dance with Dragons, but I found it thoroughly enjoyable.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002CCNA1K/ref=as_li_ss_tl?tag=theven01-20">Exile: The Legend of Drizzt, Book II</a> &ndash; More of the same: a straightforward, pleasurable hero story based in D&amp;D universe. The Drizzt series is a nice break from the more involved Wheel of Time.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1477583122/ref=as_li_ss_tl?tag=theven01-20">The Shunned House</a> &ndash; I asked friends for fantasy series recommendations and received too many good suggestions. H.P. Lovecraft was one of them, so I found this book and plowed through it. I see why people love Lovecraft! I cannot describe how, but the writing style is so evocative and creepy.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1906838356/ref=as_li_ss_tl?tag=theven01-20"> Case of Charles Dexter Ward</a> &ndash; Perhaps because I haven&rsquo;t read many graphic novels, or perhaps because I am impatient, I found myself skipping the drawing and going straight for the story. This made for a quick read. Unfortunately, I felt Lovecraft&rsquo;s ability to generate tension and suspense was was hindered by the shortened story.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1444406574/ref=as_li_ss_tl?tag=theven01-20">The Wendigo</a> - Amazon recommended this along when I got the Lovecraft book. I would have liked more description of the Wendigo (and if the story wasn&rsquo;t written a century ago I would have wanted to hear how wendigos are undiscovered), but I liked the book overall.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1587150794/ref=as_li_ss_tl?tag=theven01-20">Fifty-One Tales</a> - This is another recommendation from a friend. Apparently, <a title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Plunkett,_18th_Baron_of_Dunsany" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Plunkett,_18th_Baron_of_Dunsany">Edward Plunkett a.k.a. Lord Dunsany</a>, is one of the first fantasy authors. While The King of Elfland&rsquo;s Daughter was recommended, I was drawn to this book as an introduction to his style. Of the 51 tales, my favorites were <i>The Workman</i>&mdash;about a workman vainly struggling for immortality&mdash;and <i>A Moral Little Tale</i>, which says that Puritanical beliefs are actually devilish because God appreciates mirth.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0084B5TK8/ref=as_li_ss_tl?tag=theven01-20">Dracula</a> &ndash; A classic fantasy story that I knew but had not read. I hate redoing things, so reading a story I already knew was challenging; however, the book was good. It unfolds as a series of diary entries, which I thought was unique and clever. I am stunned at the lack of resolution&mdash;I feel like the climax is on the penultimate page.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Elements-Style-William-White-Strunk/dp/B000KW42KM/?tag=theven01-20">The Elements of Style (a.k.a. Strunk and White)</a> &ndash; This is a short book, but it was not a quick read for me. Between The Language Instinct and conversations with my linguist wife, I have come to realize that I have an elementary understanding of English grammar. Strunk and White often pressed the limits of my knowledge with highfalutin terms like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerundive">gerundive</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_clause">dependent clause</a>; however, they offer great examples that helped me understand the concepts without mastering the vocabulary.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003K15O3E/ref=as_li_ss_tl?tag=theven01-20">The Gathering Storm (The Wheel of Time Book 12)</a> &ndash; After a break, I was ready for more Wheel of Time. I read summaries for books 7-11 and jumped straight to the finale, which is written by Brandon Sanderson with the late Robert Jordan&rsquo;s notes. I don&rsquo;t know if it is Sanderson&rsquo;s writing or the fact that the books are rushing towards the end, but I loved this story. I should finish the series in another month.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0080K3G4O/?tag=theven01-20">The Antidote: Happiness for People Who Can&rsquo;t Stand Positive Thinking</a> by Oliver Burkeman. Burkeman played a nice angle in this contrarian&rsquo;s guide to happiness. He synthesized a fair amount of information and presented his path to happiness.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003E749TE/?tag=theven01-20">The Happiness Hypothesis</a> by Jonathan Haidt. This book was almost like a scientific version of The Antidote: where The Antidote is a story, The Happiness Hypothesis is a pop science textbook. Haidt did a fantastic job combining psychology and philosophy along with history and his own story. His metaphor for your mind, the elephant and the rider, is amazing. Basically, your rational mind, the rider, isn&rsquo;t really in control of your body, the elephant. For too long, people have thought of their mind and body like a car: you go left when you want to go left, right when you want to go right, and over a cliff if that&rsquo;s what you desire. But Haidt points out that you reflexively jump when you see a snake and automatically recoil from a hot surface&mdash;your body acts before your mind can process the event. Haidt suggests this is because your body has evolved to survive for much longer than your brain has. You can drive a car off a cliff, but you can&rsquo;t easily ride a horse off a cliff. Haidt extends the idea and suggests that we are emotional creatures who often wrap our feelings with rational alibis. The book covers a lot of neat studies and compares modern thought to historical perspectives.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003P8Q5QC/?tag=theven01-20">Towers of Midnight (The Wheel of Time Book 13)</a> by Robert Jordan and Brandon Sanderson. Book 12 fed nicely into 13 and I went into the finale with a full head of steam.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BMKDTNC/?tag=theven01-20">A Memory of Light (The Wheel of Time Book 14)</a> by Robert Jordan and Brandon Sanderson. How do you end an epic tale? Well, this is one way. I might have liked more information, but I didn&rsquo;t want to read yet another book. I&rsquo;m happy with Sanderson&rsquo;s tradeoff between quality and time. I&rsquo;m glad to have closure on the Rand al&#8217;Thor saga.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0010SKUYM/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0010SKUYM&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=theven01-20">The Name of the Wind by Patrick Rothfuss</a>. This book is really highly rated, and I see why. It started off slow, but I stuck with it and was rewarded. This ended up being an awesome, interesting story with a lot of neat, novel fantasy ideas. I&rsquo;ll finish off the second book soon, then wish the third was already out.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ARHAAZ6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00ARHAAZ6&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=theven01-20">Steelheart by Brandon Sanderson</a>. I&rsquo;d describe this story as what happens when Superman is a villain.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006L74DMC/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B006L74DMC&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=theven01-20">Endurance: Shackleton&rsquo;s Incredible Voyage by Alfred Lansing</a>. Remind me not to take a boat to Antarctica. Especially not in the early 20th century. I see why this has been <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0264578/">made into a movie</a> or <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0272839/">two</a>&mdash;it is the classic &ldquo;unbelievable but true&rdquo; story.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PKV4J0/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001PKV4J0&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=theven01-20">The Dog Whisperer: A Compassionate, Nonviolent Approach to Dog Training by Paul Owens and Norma Eckroate</a>. Not that Dog Whisperer (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cesar_Millan">Cesar Milan</a>). Concrete training advice came after a bit of introductory advice that was a little too hippie for me (for example, the authors suggest you feed your dog 100% organic meat and veggies, which I can agree with only in theory). A few of my favorite lessons:</p>

<ul>
<li>there are three Ds of dog training: distance, duration, and distraction. Once your dog can reliably perform, add distance, duration, or distraction. The grad school version of sit requires that your dog sit and stay for minutes while you&rsquo;re far away and all the dog&rsquo;s favorite things run by.</li>
<li>speak the command once and give your dog 45 seconds to react; right when your dog does the right thing, praise generously.</li>
<li>when your dog naturally does something you want to train, immediately name the action and praise your dog. This is called the &ldquo;Magnet Game&rdquo; and it&rsquo;s working well with my dog (we are trying to get her to show us her belly on command). Other examples are for barking (once it has been named you can encourage them to do it only on command) or incidental heeling (if your dog walks beside you, praise the dog and eventually she will learn that staying by you is best).</li>
</ul>


<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ADV2H8O/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00ADV2H8O&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=theven01-20">Sly Flourish&rsquo;s Lazy Dungeon Master by Michael Shea</a>. This book is short and sweet with a lot of neat tips, like creating character backstories using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiasco_(role-playing_game">Fiasco</a>). I&rsquo;m glad I read this book before the gaming session because it saved me a lot of time and helped me DM more gracefully, I think.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006HKVI4E/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B006HKVI4E&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=theven01-20">How to Tell a Story by Mark Twain</a>. What a poor title. This book had no direct advice about how to tell a story, and the two stories it contained were less than stellar. At least it was short.</p>

<p><a href="http://samizdat.mines.edu/howto/HowToBeAProgrammer.pdf">How to be a Programmer: A Short, Comprehensive, and Personal Summary by Robert L. Read</a>. This is a nice essay on how to be a programmer&mdash;there&rsquo;s a lot more to the job than simply writing code. Read describes skills needed as a beginner, intermediate, and advanced programmer. I think this book could form the base of a class on software or be elaborated to create a nice book on the programming profession.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00475AYJQ/?tag=theven01-20">The Wise Man&rsquo;s Fear by Patrick Rothfuss</a>.
I loved this book, and now I&rsquo;m ready for book three. Speaking of waiting
for the conclusion of a story, <a href="http://www.patrickrothfuss.com/content/reviews.asp">George R. R. Martin said</a>,
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s bloody good, this Rothfuss guy.&rdquo; May both Patrick Rothfuss and GRRM finish their series soon!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FC11AQ/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000FC11AQ&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=theven01-20&amp;linkId=OEM63HL3THDLOU4V">The Curse of Chalion by Lois McMaster Bujold</a>.
I liked this book, but it fell short of what I expected from a Hugo Award winner.
The story could have been told with many fewer words, although I don&rsquo;t claim to
know which words needed to be cut. There were some neat concepts; e.g., in this
universe there are five gods who visit mortals. The gods grant blessings and
bestow curses. There are also demons that can jump into human hosts and corrupt
the person from the inside out, while granting some supernatural abilities.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FC138Q/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000FC138Q&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=theven01-20&amp;linkId=SQKW2GDXK57IBB5F">Paladin of Souls by Lois McMaster Bujold</a>.
I had already completed the first book (The Curse of Chalion), so I continued
on to this book. I preferred this one, perhaps because the story was richer for
building on the realm of Chalion, which I had read a whole book about.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0097CWIDY/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0097CWIDY&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=theven01-20&amp;linkId=LVHIEKBKBJFQ2V4L">Boys Adrift by Leonard Sax</a>.
I thought this book made some good points, but I was ultimately unconvinced. In
the introduction, Sax says that on college campuses females outnumber males 2:1;
however, he also says that college is now 58% female and 42% male. 58:42 is not
2:1&mdash;it&rsquo;s 1.38:1. From this point on, I was much more skeptical of the
information. Sax&#8217; <a href="http://www.boysadrift.com/factors.php">five factors</a> are
video games, teaching methods, prescription drugs, endocrine disruptors, and
devaluation of masculinity; of those, each have some merit, but it felt a bit
like listening to an old person railing on young people. You know, &ldquo;back in my
day, men were men!&rdquo; The evidence felt like a collection of anecdotes and a lot
of just-so stories. Some of the ideas came across as shamefully outdated
opinions, which is unfortunate. Why is it so highly rated? I suspect because
there&rsquo;s a huge selection bias&mdash;people who do not believe boys are adrift simply
will not read the book.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0786948590/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=theven01-20&amp;linkId=AZ5FVM3FFEBFYLZO">The Legacy: Legend of Drizzt, Book VII by R.A. Salvatore</a>. It&rsquo;s Drizzt&mdash;what&rsquo;s not to like? I previously read books one and two; I mistakenly bought this one thinking it was three (it is actually 7). On the plus side, I can probably skip ahead in the story now that I know what happens after the books I missed!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FC2L1O/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=theven01-20&amp;linkId=4ANBLIVMQ7652A5D">Outlander by Diana Gabaldon</a>. Andrea loved this series and wanted to know if I would like it too. I did not, but I cannot say why. There was a lot of sex, but plenty of books I like have sex; there was romance that did not resonate with me; there was a lot of history, which I must admit I don&rsquo;t care about. I guess I would rather read about a badass Drow ranger defeating a golem than read about a woman lost in time.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00EN4Q8OQ/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=theven01-20&amp;linkId=YF3QF5TEVNFXRHAM">The Dracula Chronicles: The Lamb of God by Shane KP Oneill</a>. This was a very quick read that introduces Dracula. The first book published in this series takes place well after this prequel, but I thought it would be good to start at the beginning. It was good, so I plan to continue this series after I finish some other books.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OCXG4Q/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=theven01-20&amp;linkId=MTDSUNBSKW7ZSQGP">Across the Nightingale Floor by Lian Hearn</a>. An orphan assassin, sword-fighting, revenge and rebellion&mdash;I like it!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00JVST6CA/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=theven01-20&amp;linkId=EWWY3DMHY2TQBT7R">The Wealth of Nations by Adam Smith</a>. I&rsquo;ve heard a ton about this book, and I&rsquo;d like to have a better grasp on economics. It started off well; Smith lays the foundation of economics and currency, and it is brilliant, logical stuff. That being said, I ultimately abandoned the book about 1/6th of the way in when the author stated how much tobacco you should expect from a negro between sixteen and sixty years. I know that in 1776 statements like that were not in poor taste&mdash;Smith was likely very progressive&mdash;but one too many outdated terms made me question how applicable the book truly is. I include the book in this list because I don&rsquo;t plan to finish it.</p>

  <div class="row-fluid">
    <div class="span12 post-container">
      <h1 class="link"><a href="/my-strengths/">My Strengths</a></h1>
      <p><b>The Clifton StrengthsFinder</b></p>

<p>Strengths as determined by a survey from the &ldquo;<a title="Now, Discover Your Strengths on Amazon" href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0743201140/">Now, Discover Your Strengths</a>&rdquo; book.</p>

<p>Below are my top five themes of talent, ranked in the order revealed by my responses to the <a title="Strengths Finder" href="http://www.strengthsfinder.com">Clifton StrengthsFinder</a>.</p>

<p>As you may know, the Clifton StrengthsFinder measures the presence of talent in 34 categories called &ldquo;themes.&rdquo; These themes were determined by The Gallup Organization as those that most consistently predict outstanding performance. The greater the presence of a theme of talent within a person, the more likely that person is to spontaneously exhibit those talents in day-to-day behaviors.</p>

<p>Focusing on naturally powerful talents helps people use them as the foundation of strengths and enjoy personal, academic, and career success through consistent, near-perfect performance.</p>

<div><b>Learner</b></div>


<p>You love to learn. The subject matter that interests you most will be determined by your other themes and experiences, but whatever the subject, you will always be drawn to the process of learning. The process, more than the content or the result, is especially exciting for you. You are energized by the steady and deliberate journey from ignorance to competence. The thrill of the first few facts, the early efforts to recite or practice what you have learned, the growing confidence of a skill mastered—this is the process that entices you. Your excitement leads you to engage in adult learning experiences—yoga or piano lessons or graduate classes. It enables you to thrive in dynamic work environments where you are asked to take on short project assignments and are expected to learn a lot about the new subject matter in a short period of time and then move on to the next one. This Learner theme does not necessarily mean that you seek to become the subject matter expert, or that you are striving for the respect that accompanies a professional or academic credential. The outcome of the learning is less significant than the “getting there.”</p>

<div><b>Achiever</b></div>


<p>Your Achiever theme helps explain your drive. Achiever describes a constant need for achievement. You feel as if every day starts at zero. By the end of the day you must achieve something tangible in order to feel good about yourself. And by “every day” you mean every single day—workdays, weekends, vacations. No matter how much you may feel you deserve a day of rest, if the day passes without some form of achievement, no matter how small, you will feel dissatisfied. You have an internal fire burning inside you. It pushes you to do more, to achieve more. After each accomplishment is reached, the fire dwindles for a moment, but very soon it rekindles itself, forcing you toward the next accomplishment. Your relentless need for achievement might not be logical. It might not even be focused. But it will always be with you. As an Achiever you must learn to live with this whisper of discontent. It does have its benefits. It brings you the energy you need to work long hours without burning out. It is the jolt you can always count on to get you started on new tasks, new challenges. It is the power supply that causes you to set the pace and define the levels of productivity for your work group. It is the theme that keeps you moving.</p>

<div><b>Input</b></div>


<p>You are inquisitive. You collect things. You might collect information—words, facts, books, and quotations—or you might collect tangible objects such as butterflies, baseball cards, porcelain dolls, or sepia photographs. Whatever you collect, you collect it because it interests you. And yours is the kind of mind that finds so many things interesting. The world is exciting precisely because of its infinite variety and complexity. If you read a great deal, it is not necessarily to refine your theories but, rather, to add more information to your archives. If you like to travel, it is because each new location offers novel artifacts and facts. These can be acquired and then stored away. Why are they worth storing? At the time of storing it is often hard to say exactly when or why you might need them, but who knows when they might become useful? With all those possible uses in mind, you really don’t feel comfortable throwing anything away. So you keep acquiring and compiling and filing stuff away. It’s interesting. It keeps your mind fresh. And perhaps one day some of it will prove valuable.</p>

<div><b>Restorative</b></div>


<p>You love to solve problems. Whereas some are dismayed when they encounter yet another breakdown, you can be energized by it. You enjoy the challenge of analyzing the symptoms, identifying what is wrong, and finding the solution. You may prefer practical problems or conceptual ones or personal ones. You may seek out specific kinds of problems that you have met many times before and that you are confident you can fix. Or you may feel the greatest push when faced with complex and unfamiliar problems. Your exact preferences are determined by your other themes and experiences. But what is certain is that you enjoy bringing things back to life. It is a wonderful feeling to identify the undermining factor(s), eradicate them, and restore something to its true glory. Intuitively, you know that without your intervention, this thing—this machine, this technique, this person, this company—might have ceased to function. You fixed it, resuscitated it, rekindled its vitality. Phrasing it the way you might, you saved it.</p>

<div><b>Individualization</b></div>


<p>Your Individualization theme leads you to be intrigued by the unique qualities of each person. You are impatient with generalizations or “types” because you don’t want to obscure what is special and distinct about each person. Instead, you focus on the differences between individuals. You instinctively observe each person’s style, each person’s motivation, how each thinks, and how each builds relationships. You hear the one-of-a-kind stories in each person’s life. This theme explains why you pick your friends just the right birthday gift, why you know that one person prefers praise in public and another detests it, and why you tailor your teaching style to accommodate one person’s need to be shown and another’s desire to “figure it out as I go.” Because you are such a keen observer of other people’s strengths, you can draw out the best in each person. This Individualization theme also helps you build productive teams. While some search around for the perfect team “structure” or “process,” you know instinctively that the secret to great teams is casting by individual strengths so that everyone can do a lot of what they do well.</p>

<p>How well do you think these themes describe me?</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Individuals create; committees critique.&rdquo; Years ago a mentor, Rick Scott, helped me get unstuck with these simple words. Rick solidified the lesson with a story: to create the <a title="Declaration of Independence" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Declaration_of_Independence">Declaration of Independence</a>, the <a title="Committee of Five" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committee_of_Five">Committee of Five</a> had Thomas Jefferson write the first draft, which the group then edited and pushed through Congress. The founding fathers knew they would not make the necessary progress if they worked through every detail together.</p>

<p>To apply this to your own life and be more effective, realize that groups are better suited at critiquing than creating, so it&rsquo;s on you to prototype something, then ask for feedback and build consensus.</p>

      <p>Search has been failing me frequently in the recent past, and the problem is only getting worse. Versions are everywhere and search is not keeping up. Here are a few examples:</p>

<ul>
<li>Googling for &ldquo;mac lion&rdquo; returns 5 results for Lion and 5 for Mountain Lion on the first page. Specifying version number (e.g., &ldquo;mac lion 10.7&rdquo;) or date (e.g., &ldquo;mac lion 2011&rdquo;) does not particularly help the results.</li>
<li>World of Warcraft has repeated some items with each expansion (or retooled bosses like Onyxia and even whole zones like Naxxramus). Searching for the item may lead you to the 2010 incarnation. Simply adding 2012 or the expansion name is often ineffective because the pages will contain dates and expansion names throughout the content. Another example: there are over <a title="Fortune Card -- what version???" href="http://www.wowhead.com/item=60840/fortune-card">50 virtually identical fortune cards</a>.</li>
<li>A similar idea occurs in GitHub branches. For example, if you&rsquo;re looking for <a title="Toopher Ruby" href="https://github.com/toopher/toopher-ruby">Toopher&rsquo;s Ruby client</a> (which rocks!) then you might find my fork that was already merged with master.</li>
<li>In my personalized search results for &ldquo;cross platform password management,&rdquo; Google returns an outdated <a title="Outdated -- Lifehacker's five best password managers" href="http://lifehacker.com/5042616/five-best-password-managers">Lifehacker article from 2008</a> above more recent articles. In this case, recency trumps Lifehacker&rsquo;s relevance and authority.</li>
<li>While learning Clojure (at version 1.4) I kept finding StackOverflow responses like, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s how to do it in Clojure 1.2.&rdquo; The more dangerous response was &ldquo;here&rsquo;s how to do it in Clojure&rdquo; with no mention of versioning. I spent hours trying to get the outdated procedures to work only to have them fail.</li>
<li>There are bugs that exist for certain operating systems with certain versions of dependent projects. Like <a title="Ruby 1.9.2 seg faults with OpenSSL" href="http://www.christopherirish.com/2011/09/02/ruby-1-9-2-segmentation-fault-and-openssl/">Ruby 1.9.2+ on Mac OS X Lion when installed with RVM 1.0 or higher</a>. Searching for this was difficult because it required so many versions.</li>
</ul>


<p>Some of these examples would be prevented by using advanced search options and narrowing results to the past year; however, I feel that&rsquo;s a cop-out for a poor user experience.</p>

<p>Until search engines gain additional processing, I think we should get familiar with scoping search results and ask that answers contain version information for increased searchability.</p>

<p>I think search has to solve versioning&mdash;what do you think?</p>

      <p>Over the years I have played with a few different resume styles. I had the <a title="Seth Holloway's outdated LaTeX resume" href="https://github.com/smholloway/resume/tree/master/latex">LaTeX template</a>, the <a title="Seth Holloway's timeline resume" href="http://www.sethholloway.com/timelineResume.html">timeline resume</a>, the <a title="Seth Holloway's responsive design resume" href="http://www.sethholloway.com/resume.html">responsive resume</a> (resize your browser or check it out on your phone), and the old school World of Warcraft character builder style resume. This post is meant to showcase the RPG character builder resume that I never publicized. Check it out:</p>

<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1869" alt="Seth Holloway Character Builder Resume Screenshot" src="/images/Screenshot-February-16-2013.png" width="505" height="439" /></a></p>

<p>If the screenshot leaves you wanting, you can see my <a title="Seth Holloway RPG Character Builder Resume" href="http://sethholloway.com/alternativeResume.html">RPG style resume live</a> and check out <a title="WoW character builder" href="http://wowtal.com/#k=ff-.bqj.druid.">World of Warcraft Character Builder</a> for the inspiration.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve also <a title="Seth Holloway's resumes on GitHub " href="https://github.com/smholloway/resume">open sourced the resumes</a>. The individual READMEs there provide some more information about each template. I hope others will find this interesting and valuable.</p>

<p>As always, please post your questions and comments :)</p>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/lisp-and-order-of-operations-pemdas/">Lisp and order of operations (PEMDAS)</a></h1>
      <p>Somewhere around third grade I had the order of operations drilled into my head: parentheses, exponent, multiplication, division, addition, subtraction&mdash;abbreviated as PEMDAS and pronounced &ldquo;pem doss.&rdquo; PEMDAS allows you to succinctly communicate mathematical expressions.</p>

<p>5 + 3<sup>2</sup> * 7</p>

<p>Moving through PEMDAS we see there are no parentheses, but there is an exponent: 3<sup>2</sup> == 3*3 == 9. Continuing through PEMDAS we hit the M for multiplication; our example has the middle term multiplied by 7. Finally, we add 5.</p>

<p>Written in a Lisp style the same expression would look something like this:</p>

<p>(+ 5 (* 7 (pow 3 2)))</p>

<p>Rules implicitly encoded in math must be explicitly written in Lisp (or any pre- or post-fix notation for that matter). In various other languages (<a title="REPL.it is a collection of online REPLs" href="http://repl.it" target="_blank">try a few</a>) the order of operations is encoded already.</p>

<p>In a way, it is frustrating that the programming language ignores basic math rules; however, there may be benefits. I wonder, how many bugs would have been avoided by forcing people to use parentheses to group expressions? how much slower was it to type the extra keystrokes? how many future Lispers were snuffed out by explicit mathematics?</p>

<p>How do you feel about the encoding? Does pre-fix notation bother you more in another way?</p>

      <p>When I get good at something I tend to lose empathy for beginners. I&rsquo;m not unique in that regard. Reflecting on negative experiences, it was often when a senior person made me feel dumb for being new. This happens at work, in life, even in school (how many college profs answer questions gracefully?).</p>

<p>To counteract the loss of connection, I think it is important to always be a novice at something. Said another way, always be learning.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003BQZ80M/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B003BQZ80M&linkCode=as2&tag=theven01-20">Lord of Chaos: Book Six of &lsquo;The Wheel of Time&rsquo;</a> &ndash; I finished up book six of the Wheel of Time series and am ready for a break. This book felt like a slog, but ended really well. Some friends advised I skip the middle, so I think I&rsquo;ll read summaries before jumping to book 12 to start the finale.</p>

Robin Williams shows how to transform boring, bad designs using CRAP&mdash;that&rsquo;s contrast, repetition, alignment, and proximity. The second edition is a bit dated; perhaps the third edition is closer to today&rsquo;s flat UI trend.</p>

I wish I would have read this earlier, but I probably wouldn&rsquo;t have gotten much out of it because I didn&rsquo;t think I needed it. I found that the deep dives into new subjects that I frequently did during my PhD is called syntopical reading.</p>

As with many business books, you could summarize it in one blog post, but then you lose the nuance. I&rsquo;m curious how Drucker would argue that a busy executive should read his entire book instead of a concise summary.</p>

This was a quick read with some interesting points. I was intrigued by thinking about whose problem something is and how decision makers&#8217; interests rarely align with he people experiencing the problem.</p>
