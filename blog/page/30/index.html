<p>I&rsquo;ll admit, I don&rsquo;t think I knew any of those things. I&rsquo;m not sure any of them are relevant to anything, but they&rsquo;re interesting bits of trivia. I like that he won a Grammy, did drugs, and wants to put a basketball court on the White House grounds.</p>

      <p>I came across a website that <a title="Obama CTO" href="http://obamacto.org/" target="_blank">tallies votes on technological ideas that the Obama CTO</a> will hopefully take to heart. I like the voting scheme employed; you&rsquo;re given 10 votes and you can give up to three votes per idea&mdash;kind of like the <a title="wikipedia Condorcet" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet_method" target="_blank">Condorcet voting method</a> <a title="seth holloway dot com comments" href="http://sethholloway.com/blog/?p=205" target="_blank">I learned about</a> during this presidential election.</p>

<p>I agreed with the top three choices (net neutrality, repeal the patriot act, and repeal the DMCA), so these received one vote each. I also put one point into restoring DARPA because I&rsquo;m a fan of futuristic research that may have no commercial impacts for years to come. I put three votes towards more research into energy and rethinking IP law because those are two of my biggest technological pet peeves.</p>

<p>The site has a lot of good ideas, although I would like to see more about security. All the money and technology in the world will be useless if we do not have control of our own machines. America has criminalized hacking rather than studying it; without knowledge of hacking, how can we stop it?</p>

<p>I would also like to see more push for improving technological infrastructure so that America can continue to compete in the future. We know the theory, but other nations are actually implementing these cool ideas.</p>

<p>In your opinion is the site missing any good ideas? Where did you put your 10 votes?</p>

      <p>I&rsquo;ve previously wondered if <a title="wikipedia AIDS" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIDS" target="_blank">AIDS</a> and <a title="wikiepedia leukemia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia" target="_blank">Leukemia</a> would cancel each other out. That may not make sense on the surface, but AIDS attacks <a title="wikipedia C4 T cells" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_helper_cell" target="_blank">C4</a> T cells, which are <a title="wikipedia lymphocyte" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocytes" target="_blank">lymphocytes</a>, and Leukemia is an unchecked proliferation of <a title="wikipedia Leukocytes" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukocytes" target="_blank">leukocytes</a> (white blood cells) which includes lymphocytes. In my uneducated estimation, the excess of white blood cells produced by Leukemia could be enough to counteract the white blood cells killed by AIDS.</p>

<p>Apparently this does not work. An American living in Berlin had AIDS and Leukemia simultaneously. The patient is notable because he has been <a title="Wired.com article on AIDS treatment" href="http://news.wired.com/dynamic/stories/E/EU_MED_AIDS_TREATMENT" target="_blank">&ldquo;cured&rdquo; of AIDS</a> after receiving a bone marrow transplant. The  article does not mention whether or not Leukemia is cured, but I assume it is. We definitely need to step up research on genes and stem cells!</p>

      <p>As a Texan, I know <a title="American Football" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Football" target="_blank">football</a> (American football, not soccer) is serious business. But whenever I say it, I am half joking. I grew up playing football; I went to a high school where athletics were a big deal; and now, my university <a title="Mack Brown Texas Football" href="http://www.mackbrown-texasfootball.com/" target="_blank">makes a big deal about football</a>. (UT does have a <a title="UT rankings" href="http://rivals.yahoo.com/ncaa/football/polls" target="_blank">great football program</a>, although I&rsquo;d love to see research get some of those mega bucks&mdash;but that&rsquo;s a different story entirely). I say, &ldquo;I am half joking&rdquo; because I know how serious football is, but I lament that shows (like <a title="Wikipedia Friday Night Lights" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friday_Night_Lights_(TV_series)" target="_blank">Friday Night Lights)</a> depict Texans as hat-wearing, beer-swilling cowboys who live for weekend football. We&rsquo;re not all like that :)</p>

<p>And now that I&rsquo;ve said my piece about football in Texas&hellip; here&rsquo;s the story that inspired the post in the first place: A <a title="LSU-Bama argument leads to death" href="http://msn.foxsports.com/cfb/story/8777938/Cops:-Ala.-LSU-argument-led-to-two-deaths" target="_blank">couple was killed</a> over an argument over last week&rsquo;s intense football game between LSU and Alabama. Alabama, one of the top teams in the nation, won in overtime. Some taunting between fans led to gunfire and two people dying. Sadly, college football is serious business.</p>

Garriott recently accomplished his lifelong dream of <a title="Richard In Space" href="http://www.richardinspace.com/" target="_blank">traveling into space</a>, and he&rsquo;s now looking to focus his efforts on new projects.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been a big fan of Lord British since my days as an <a title="UO Official Site" href="http://www.uoherald.com/news/" target="_blank">Ultima Online</a> (UO for those in the know) junkie. UO was and is an amazing game (no, I don&rsquo;t play anymore). Beyond the game, he&rsquo;s owns some amazing properties around Austin. Years ago he would host lavish Halloween parties at his castle residence in Austin. By the time I found out about the event the parties had stopped, so I drove by the house and partied by myself.</p>

<p>The man is a game designing genius and I&rsquo;m sad to hear that he&rsquo;s leaving the field but I wish him all the best. Godspeed Lord British!</p>

      <p>Assuming <a title="IQ basics" href="http://www.iqcomparisonsite.com/IQBasics.aspx" target="_blank">IQ follows a normal distribution</a>, the smartest third of India outnumber the entire population of the United States of America; the smartest quarter of China outnumber the entire population of the US.</p>

<p>This point was countered by an Indian friend of mine who pointed out that &ldquo;it does not matter because half of India is illiterate.&rdquo; I&rsquo;m not sure that&rsquo;s true, but I know that the above fact made me go &ldquo;hmm&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p>This is potentially damning for countries that do not have sheer numbers as a resource. What do you think? Will nations with the highest population achieve global dominance or is there something more to the equation?</p>

From the story we learn that the current die-off is the highest ever seen in history. The article has the possibility to be more sensational, but the author does not go the extra mile. No cries of &ldquo;the end is nigh&rdquo; although the feeling is there. As with the recent coverage of banks closing, there is no information about how to stop the crisis, only that we should all run and hide.
