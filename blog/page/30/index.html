      <p><a title="Seth Holloway I Hate Being Sick" href="http://sethholloway.com/blog/?p=329" target="_blank">Yesterday</a>, I felt terrible. Today, I&rsquo;m recovering nicely. I may even be able to leave the house tomorrow!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure what did me in, although I&rsquo;ve considered an infection from my biking accident or residual effects of the flu shot. Ultimately, I think it was just a stomach bug that hit while my body was weakened.</p>

      <p><a title="Wikipedia Richard Garriott" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Garriott" target="_blank">Richard &ldquo;Lord British&rdquo; Garriott</a>, has announced that <a title="Garriot leaving NCSoft" href="http://www.rgtr.com/news/latest_news/an_open_letter_from_general_br.html" target="_blank">he is leaving NCSoft</a> and the game that bears his name, <a title="Tabula Rasa Official Site" href="http://www.rgtr.com/index.html" target="_blank">Richard Garriott&rsquo;s Tabula Rasa</a>. Garriott recently accomplished his lifelong dream of <a title="Richard In Space" href="http://www.richardinspace.com/" target="_blank">traveling into space</a>, and he&rsquo;s now looking to focus his efforts on new projects.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been a big fan of Lord British since my days as an <a title="UO Official Site" href="http://www.uoherald.com/news/" target="_blank">Ultima Online</a> (UO for those in the know) junkie. UO was and is an amazing game (no, I don&rsquo;t play anymore). Beyond the game, he&rsquo;s owns some amazing properties around Austin. Years ago he would host lavish Halloween parties at his castle residence in Austin. By the time I found out about the event the parties had stopped, so I drove by the house and partied by myself.</p>

<p>The man is a game designing genius and I&rsquo;m sad to hear that he&rsquo;s leaving the field but I wish him all the best. Godspeed Lord British!</p>

      <p>The first thought through my mind this morning was, &ldquo;Oh no! I&rsquo;m going to throw up!&rdquo; Since then my day has alternated between sleeping and throwing up.</p>

<p>I hate being sick, but luckily it does not happen often. I&rsquo;m hoping this is a 24 stomach bug and not the flu&hellip; We&rsquo;ll see how I feel tomorrow.</p>

      <p>Assuming <a title="IQ basics" href="http://www.iqcomparisonsite.com/IQBasics.aspx" target="_blank">IQ follows a normal distribution</a>, the smartest third of India outnumber the entire population of the United States of America; the smartest quarter of China outnumber the entire population of the US.</p>

<p>This point was countered by an Indian friend of mine who pointed out that &ldquo;it does not matter because half of India is illiterate.&rdquo; I&rsquo;m not sure that&rsquo;s true, but I know that the above fact made me go &ldquo;hmm&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p>This is potentially damning for countries that do not have sheer numbers as a resource. What do you think? Will nations with the highest population achieve global dominance or is there something more to the equation?</p>

      <p>Wired published an article entitled the <a title="Wired: Latest Extinction is the Greatest" href="http://blog.wired.com/wiredscience/2008/09/latest-extincti.html" target="_blank">Latest Extinction is the Greatest</a>. From the story we learn that the current die-off is the highest ever seen in history. The article has the possibility to be more sensational, but the author does not go the extra mile. No cries of &ldquo;the end is nigh&rdquo; although the feeling is there. As with the recent coverage of banks closing, there is no information about how to stop the crisis, only that we should all run and hide. I&rsquo;ll see you guys on Mars&mdash;I&rsquo;ll be the one in the tinfoil hat!</p>

<p>Obama inherits a range of problems; I&rsquo;m curious to see where protecting species falls.</p>

      <p>Today is a very exciting day for the <a title="SSE" href="http://www.edge.utexas.edu/sse/" target="_blank">Students in Software Engineering</a> (SSE)! <a title="Ambler's homepage" href="http://users.ece.utexas.edu/~ambler/" target="_blank">Chairman Ambler</a> will be presenting today. He is ostensibly the biggest name we have had yet and we expect a large turnout. I hope we got enough food!</p>

<p>In a similar vein, the updated <a title="Software Engineering at UT" href="http://www.edge.utexas.edu/se/" target="_blank">Software Engineering website</a> is up. I think it looks clean while intuitively presenting all the useful information.</p>

<p>On a completely unrelated note&hellip; <a title="Rock Auto" href="https://www.rockauto.com/" target="_blank">Rock Auto part</a>s is an amazing online catalog of (believe it or not) auto parts. I was able to find a random knob for an affordable $6! If you need some parts, check it out.</p>

<p>Also, if you haven&rsquo;t seen this site before, <a title="123People" href="http://www.123people.com/" target="_blank">123 peopl</a>e aggregates online information about people. Apparently I have a web presence that I can be proud of. Do you?</p>

      <p>I&rsquo;m a big fan of Psychology; in fact, I&rsquo;ve seriously considered getting a degree in Psychology. Alas, I&rsquo;m going to have a PhD in engineering, so Psychology must wait. In the meantime, I like to read about the field as time permits. I just read a <a title="Why do they all look alike?" href="http://www.apa.org/monitor/dec00/lookalike.html" target="_self">very interesting article</a> about perceiving other races. In 2000 psychologist, Levin, posited that humans first perceive race then move into further reviews. Up until this work people accepted that humans acquired &ldquo;perceptual expertise&rdquo; about their own race.</p>

<p>Levin&rsquo;s research points to the fact that people perceive race as a whole rather than individual characteristics when looking at other races. To counteract the way your brain works you have to reexamine another race&rsquo;s facial feature and key in on differences.</p>

      <p>&hellip;than it is on a bike. Riding home from school yesterday I slipped into a rut, lost control, and wiped out. I felt myself going down and exclaimed &ldquo;Oh no!&rdquo; On a side note, I think you can tell a lot about a person by how they act in an uncontrolled situation. Notice, despite the fact that I normally cuss like a sailor, I exclaimed like a withered old man when I crashed.</p>

<p>Anyway, I hit on my left elbow, left knee, and right hand. The pedals scraped my right calf into a really cool pattern that looks like a tiger took a swipe at me&mdash;that&rsquo;s the story I&rsquo;ll give the ladies. I was basically in shock when it happened.</p>

<p>Luckily Dave was with me. He stopped riding and came back to help me up. He spot checked my bike and righted the handlebars then walked with me for a block. I was able to ride home after stopping at Dave&rsquo;s to wipe up some blood. My body is sore, but I&rsquo;m none the worse for wear!</p>

<p>Now that I&rsquo;ve crashed, I&rsquo;ve satisfied the requirement and I should be accident free for the rest of my life :)</p>

      <p>A young black man is the next president of the United States of America. Congratulations to Obama on the win! McCain&rsquo;s concession speech showed that McCain is a decent person after all.</p>

<p>Talking to a few people on Election Day &lsquo;08, they said they prefered McCain when he wasn&rsquo;t running for office. I feel the same way; McCain is an American hero, but he screwed the pooch on this campaign. God help us to not get Palin in 2012!</p>

      <p><a title="Personality Types" href="http://sethholloway.com/blog/?p=83" target="_blank">Previously</a> I posted about personality types using the Briggs/Meyers/Jung test. On that system I am an ENTP (Extroverted Intuitive Thinker Perceiver). Another take on personality types, which is also based on Jung, was recommended: The Enneagram. A nice description can be found <a title="enneagraminstitute.com homepage" href="http://www.enneagraminstitute.com/intro.asp" target="_blank">here.</a> If you don&rsquo;t want to read the full description, here&rsquo;s the abridged version:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.enneagraminstitute.com/images/E-TypesName.gif"><img title="Enneagram Graphic" src="http://www.enneagraminstitute.com/images/E-TypesName.gif" alt="Enneagram visualized" width="367" height="190" /></a></p>

<blockquote>Type <strong>One</strong> is principled, purposeful, self-controlled, and perfectionistic.

Type <strong>Two</strong> is demonstrative, generous, people-pleasing, and possessive.

Type <strong>Three</strong> is adaptive, excelling, driven, and image-conscious.

Type <strong>Four</strong> is expressive, dramatic, self-absorbed, and temperamental.

Type <strong>Five</strong> is perceptive, innovative, secretive, and isolated.

Type <strong>Six</strong> is engaging, responsible, anxious, and suspicious.

Type <strong>Seven</strong> is spontaneous, versatile, distractible, and scattered.

Type <strong>Eight</strong> is self-confident, decisive, willful, and confrontational.

Type <strong>Nine</strong> is receptive, reassuring, agreeable, and complacent.</blockquote>


<p>Source: <a title="Enneagram described" href="http://www.enneagraminstitute.com/intro.asp" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.enneagraminstitute.com/intro.asp">http://www.enneagraminstitute.com/intro.asp</a></a></p>

<p>A thorough test can be found <a title="similarminds.com enneagram test" href="http://similarminds.com/embj.html" target="_blank">here</a> and a shorter version <a title="similarminds.com shorter enneagram test" href="http://similarminds.com/cgi-bin/similarminds.pl" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>Based on the long test I am a Type One or Type Eight. I mention both because the scores were like 73% for Type One and 71% for Type Eight; the difference is not statistically significant in my opinion and I&rsquo;m not sure which one I&rsquo;d rather claim ;&ndash;) With either type I fall into the Instinctive category (as opposed to Thinking or Feeling).</p>

<p>So what type are you?</p>

<p>Learning about yourself is fun! Understanding yourself and your surroundings is one of the tenets of philosophers from Socrates to Shakespeare to Rand. Because it is so important, there are a lot of versions of personality type; for example, Frued also has a number of tests. If you&rsquo;re interested, you can find a more exhaustive list <a title="similarminds.com list of personality tests" href="http://similarminds.com/personality_tests.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
