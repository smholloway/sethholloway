      <p><a title="Akismet comment spam protection" href="http://akismet.com/">Akismet</a> does a good job of preventing most spam comments from showing up on my blog; however, a new style of comment is getting by the filter. Essentially, the comments will flatter the blog in a vague yet realistic manner. Below are some recent samples that I had to mark myself&mdash;they&rsquo;re remarkably similar to some comments that I have not marked as spam.</p>

<blockquote>Hello there. Cool site!! Guy.. Stunning.. Terrific.. My goal is to bookmark your online site along with take the enters additionally…I am happy to find many useful information in this article within the post. I would like to show some gratitude to sharing…</blockquote>


<blockquote>Hey there superb blog! Does running a blog such as this take a lot of work?
I’ve absolutely no expertise in programming but I had been hoping to start my own blog in the near future. Anyhow, should you have any suggestions or tips for new blog owners please share. I understand this is off subject nevertheless I simply needed to ask. Thanks a lot!</blockquote>


<blockquote>I just couldn’t depart your website prior to suggesting that I

actually enjoyed the standard info a person provide for your visitors? Is going to be back often in

order to check up on new posts</blockquote>


<p>The differentiators I&rsquo;ve found: spam comments will include a URL, name, or email that is related to selling something, while genuine comments often lack a URL and have name and email that are closely related (e.g., commenter Foo Bar would have an email address like <a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#x74;&#x6f;&#58;&#102;&#111;&#x6f;&#64;&#98;&#x61;&#x72;&#x2e;&#x63;&#x6f;&#109;">&#102;&#x6f;&#x6f;&#64;&#98;&#97;&#114;&#x2e;&#x63;&#111;&#x6d;</a>).</p>

<p>I guess spammers figure the comments are free to post (posted by bots), so why not?</p>

      <p>I completed my PhD in May 2011. My dissertation, <a title="Simplifying the Programming of Intelligent Environments at UT Library" href="http://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/handle/2152/ETD-UT-2011-05-3368">Simplifying the Programming of Intelligent Environments</a>, was basically about making home automation usable. Below is the abstract.</p>

<h3>Abstract</h3>


<p>In the future, computers will be virtually everywhere: carried by everyone and integrated into the environment. The increased computation and communication capabilities will enable intelligent environments that react to occupants through automated decision-making. Devices (sensors and actuators) are the key to making intelligent environments a reality. We believe that devices must be made more approachable for average users. Existing approaches to application development for intelligent environments require detailed knowledge about devices and their low-leveling programming interfaces, which greatly limits the number of potential users. Instead of limiting users, we must enable everyone to program the devices around them. Intelligent environments will not be commonplace until average people can set up and manage the hardware and software necessary for their personalized applications.</p>

<p>In simplifying the programming of intelligent environments, we ?rst made sensors and actuators accessible to average programmers then extended our work to end-users. We term the former contribution Sensor Enablement for Average Programmers (SEAP); the latter work is Sensor Enablement for End-Users (SEEU). In our experience, devices’ disparate, niche programming languages and communication protocols presented great di?culty in developing intelligent environments. To ease the development e?ort for average  programmers, we abstracted and standardized complex sensor and actuator  interactions, allowing users to instead think in terms of well-understood web applications. Users have said that SEAP is easy-to-use and exciting. But what about average people, end-users?</p>

<p>We found that end-users are incredibly interested in intelligent environments. By engaging end-users we can create intelligent environments even faster and allow domain experts to tailor their environment. This dissertation’s second contribution, Sensor Enablement for End-Users (SEEU) provides a visual programming interface that allows users to create personalized automated behaviors given available devices and data. We performed several user studies to uncover people’s desires for intelligent environments and determine the best interface for managing an intelligent environment. SEEU combines an intuitive interface with the power and ?exibility of SEAP. SEEU is a usable end-user programming framework that allows average people to create useful applications for their intelligent environments.</p>

<p>With SEEU and SEAP, we simplified the development of intelligent  environments, reducing barriers to adoption of emerging sensing and actuation technologies. We demonstrated the feasability with a series of user studies.</p>

<p>So, what does this really mean? Essentially, I wanted sensors and actuators to be internet-enabled, an idea that is now called the Internet of Things (IoT). I worked on the backend to design a system that allowed developers to connect devices generically using standard HTTP. That was capped off with an end-user programming framework allowing everyone to process the newly available sensors and actuators.</p>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/when-to-use-the-phd-suffix/">When to use the PhD suffix</a></h1>
      <p>I struggle with when to include the PhD suffix. I try not to flaunt my degree, but I worked hard and want the PhD to be worth something&mdash;that means I can&rsquo;t downplay it. Work is one place where degrees (might) matter. There are potential downsides to using the PhD at work though.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s roughly when I include (marked yes) or omit (marked no) the PhD:</p>

<ul>
<li>Resume: yes</li>
<li>Email signature: yes</li>
<li>Business card: yes</li>
<li>Presentations (title slide): yes</li>
<li>LinkedIn: no</li>
<li>Name tags: no</li>
<li>Verbal introductions: no</li>
</ul>


<p>Does that seem reasonable to you? Have a missed a situation? I suppose the tried-and-true advice is &ldquo;know your audience&rdquo; and use the PhD when it will be advantageous.</p>

      <p>This weekend I wrote <a title="Seth Holloway: Rhythm test" href="http://sethholloway.com/timing.html">a simple webpage to measure the accuracy of my rhythm</a> (the <a title="GitHub: JavaScript timing project" href="https://github.com/smholloway/miscellaneous/tree/master/javascript/timing">timing project on GitHub</a>). Just load the page then start tapping any key(s) periodically; the page records and reports on the time between key-presses.</p>

<p>In playing with the page my standard deviation normally hovered around 20ms, drifting up towards 40ms. This was without a metronome.</p>

<p>Open questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>What is a good accuracy?</li>
<li>How long should a rhythm test last? Five seconds seems too short and five minutes seems too long.</li>
<li>Am I reporting the proper statistics?</li>
<li>Is my quick attempt at measuring rhythm flawed? JavaScript may be too slow or imprecise. Are there bugs?</li>
<li>How can the app be improved?</li>
</ul>


<p>How&rsquo;s your accuracy? Got any ideas? Please let me know!</p>

      <p>In 2012 I discovered <a title="Rich Hickey on Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/richhickey">Rich Hickey</a> and he blew my mind. I think Hickey is one of the most important computer scientists of our time&mdash;we will see this in the next five to years. See his amazing presentations and creations like <a title="Are We There Yet presentation" href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Are-We-There-Yet-Rich-Hickey">Are We There Yet?</a>, <a title="Value of Values presentation" href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Value-Values">The Value of Values</a>, <a title="Simple Made Easy presentation" href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy">Simple Made Easy</a>, <a title="Clojure" href="http://clojure.org/">Clojure</a>, <a title="Datomic" href="http://www.datomic.com/">Datomic</a>, and <a href="http://www.infoq.com/author/Rich-Hickey">more</a>. Fueled by several great videos, I started learning Clojure. Here are my notes from the experience.</p>

<ul>
<li>I like that Clojure builds on Lisp. I feel like I&rsquo;m working on something cutting edge, yet proven. It feels like joining a dynasty, perhaps.</li>
<li>With Clojure, you write right to left, which is new and different. The prefix notation was not intuitive for me.</li>
</ul>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<ul>
<li><p>Map, Reduce, and Filter are really flexible. For example, reduce can be used to implement join really easily. Learning to think this way has not been immediate for me.</p>

<p> Clojure: (reduce #(str %1 &ldquo; &rdquo; %2) &lsquo;(&ldquo;the&rdquo;, &ldquo;quick&rdquo;, &ldquo;brown&rdquo;, &ldquo;fox&rdquo;, &ldquo;jumps&rdquo;, &ldquo;over&rdquo;, &ldquo;the&rdquo;, &ldquo;lazy&rdquo;, &ldquo;dog&rdquo;))
 JavaScript: [&ldquo;the&rdquo;, &ldquo;quick&rdquo;, &ldquo;brown&rdquo;, &ldquo;fox&rdquo;, &ldquo;jumps&rdquo;, &ldquo;over&rdquo;, &ldquo;the&rdquo;, &ldquo;lazy&rdquo;, &ldquo;dog&rdquo;].join(&ldquo; &rdquo;) == [&ldquo;the&rdquo;, &ldquo;quick&rdquo;, &ldquo;brown&rdquo;, &ldquo;fox&rdquo;, &ldquo;jumps&rdquo;, &ldquo;over&rdquo;, &ldquo;the&rdquo;, &ldquo;lazy&rdquo;, &ldquo;dog&rdquo;].reduce(function(a,b){return a + &ldquo; &rdquo; + b;})</p></li>
<li><p>Chaining functions together is fun.</p></li>
<li>2 + 4 is really applying the add function to two arguments (2 and 4). This seems like an obvious statement, but I normally think of the plus sign simply as an operator rather than a function. Clojure, Lisp really, wears new grooves in the brain.</li>
<li>It can be hard to get the iterative approach out of my head. For example, Project Euler problems to find the 2,000th prime feels like &ldquo;generate 2,000 primes and return the last one&rdquo; and to find the prime after 4,000,000 would be &ldquo;while the prime is less than 4 million, find the next prime.&rdquo; I had a hard time thinking of these functionally.</li>
<li>Lisp can be really clever and readable, and Clojure can be written almost the exact same way. Except that Lisp-style code in Clojure will blow the stack (due to the JVM&rsquo;s lack of ability to tail-call optimize) or perform like crap (the compiler needs &ldquo;hints&rdquo; to optimize performance). Suddenly, your beautiful recursive call turns into this less-readable loop-recur mess.</li>
<li>Following on the previous point, Lisp can be really unreadable. The language does not layer on any discipline, so the developers better do it. And it turns out that naming functions appropriately is really hard.</li>
<li>The standard library is really nice. It is lengthy, which makes it hard to learn.</li>
<li>There are a ton of great resources online. They can be woefully out-of-date.</li>
<li>In roughly 1 day, I was able to understand more code than I would have expected. I could not do much with that knowledge :)</li>
<li>I felt like I had to go to Clojure because it was not coming to me. I believe this reflects Rich Hickey&rsquo;s ethos: he created the language for a reason and wants you to use it in the intended way.</li>
<li>It was hard to convince my peers that Clojure was the language of the future. One of the most common questions was, &ldquo;are there any large system written in Clojure in production?&rdquo; Based on the reactions, I doubt Clojure will enter the mainstream anytime soon.</li>
</ul>


<p>Overall, I enjoyed learning Clojure and I feel it made me a better programmer. If you haven&rsquo;t checked it out, <a title="4clojure Problem 1" href="http://www.4clojure.com/problem/1">work through a few problems</a> and see what you think.</p>

      <p>Rewarding good behavior is really hard! Hard, but worthwhile.</p>

<p>Before I volunteered at an elementary school I had a vague idea about not rewarding troublemakers. Unfortunately, when I was in front of four classes of eager students, my ideas were tested. I called on the troublemakers, a lot.</p>

<p>This got me thinking about rewarding good behavior. If you have an unpleasant experience at a restaurant, you&rsquo;ll likely pay, leave, and never return. However, if you make a fuss, you can have your meal paid for by an apologetic manager. Almost universally it seems that a hissy-fit will get you everywhere. A friend of mine who worked in retail quipped that employees were instructed to accept any return for a full refund after the customer raised his voice. &ldquo;The squeaky wheel gets the grease.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As a reaction to my experience, I am trying to give credit when credit is due and to reward good behavior that I see around me. It feels strange to positively enforce a pleasant experience&mdash;it is much easier for me to complain about an unpleasant experience. Nothing good comes easy, eh?</p>

<p>How do <em>you</em> reward good behavior?</p>

      <p>Yet another post that never got published&hellip;</p>

<p>For my own memory as much as anything else, I thought I&rsquo;d list some of the highlights.</p>

<h2>Books</h2>


<p><strong>Cryptonomicon</strong> &ndash; Neal Stephenson: I conquered this book. Mike graciously presented me with this monster on my birthday last year. After a few months reading slowly, I read more seriously and knocked the book out quickly. Not as good as The Diamond Age, but I always love Stephenson.</p>

<p><strong>Twilight</strong> &ndash; Stephenie Meyers: I think I should be embarrassed that I finished it.</p>

<p><strong>Blood and Gold</strong> &ndash; Ann Rice: I&rsquo;m a fan of the Vampire Chronicles, but this book was a little too out there for me.</p>

<h2>Movies (in order of preference)</h2>


<p><strong>Sherlock Holmes</strong>: Just what I need! Another good action/adventure/mystery series. Really great cast (has Robert Downey Jr. done been in a bad movie since his recovery). I hope they make a lot of these!</p>

<p><strong>Avatar</strong>: Entertaining, yes; deep, no. Watch it in 3D and enjoy.</p>

<p><strong>Men Who Stare At Goats</strong>: I enjoyed the movie and laughed a lot. I&rsquo;m not sure it was supposed to be that comical, but I have a thing for &ldquo;the Dude, man&rdquo; (Jeff Bridges).</p>

<h2>TV Shows</h2>


<p><strong>30 Rock</strong>: Hilarious and wonderfully entertaining. This show turns me into that guy&mdash;yep, I laugh out loud sitting on the couch with my cat.</p>

<p><strong>Heroes</strong>: I&rsquo;ve now watched every episode (thanks Netflix!). Season 1 was fantastic! Season 2 and 3 were kinda good, however, Season 4 was a let down.</p>

<p><strong>Californication</strong>: I remember seeing the stories about David Duchovny being a sex addict in real life, which was ironic because that&rsquo;s what he plays in the show. Some said it was just a publicity stunt. I don&rsquo;t know either way, but he&rsquo;s awesome in the show about a vulnerable writer/father/ex struggling to do his best in life.</p>
