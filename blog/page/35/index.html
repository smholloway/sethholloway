      <p>The election is a month away, and today is the last day you can register to vote! Do it!</p>

<p>While the politicians bicker and blame one another about <a title="Analysis of what really happened" href="http://techdirt.com/articles/20080929/0426042403.shtml" target="_blank">what happened</a>, the rest of us are left holding the bag. If you&rsquo;re like me, you&rsquo;re ready for someone new. Can&rsquo;t wait to vote? You may be eligible for early voting! <a title="Early Voting Information Center" href="http://earlyvoting.net/states/abslaws.php" target="_blank">The Early Voting Inforation Center</a> is a great resource for determining if you can vote early.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the detailed blurb about Texas:</p>

Early voting in person starts 17 days before each election unless the first day falls on the weekend, then early voting begins on the following Monday and ends 4 days before each election. <span class="source"><a title="Tex.

      <p>The local NBC affiliate, <a title="KXAN" href="http://www.kxan.com/" target="_blank">KXAN</a>, is no longer being shown on <a title="Time Warner in Austin" href="http://www.timewarnercable.com/centraltx/" target="_blank">Time Warner</a> cable. Instead of showing the NBC broadcast, Time Warner is airing a <a title="Truth Hurts KXAN" href="http://www.thetruthhurtskxan.com/main.php" target="_blank">one-sided smear campaign</a> that would have consumers believe that KXAN is to blame.</p>

<p>First of all, I don&rsquo;t have a choice in my local cable and internet provider. Despite the fact that <a title="Grande Communications" href="http://www.grandecom.com/" target="_blank">Grande Communications</a> offers great deals all around me, I can only use Time Warner. In the past five apartments I&rsquo;ve lived in, I had no choice. The cable companies offer their product at a price and the consumer has to take it or leave it. Where&rsquo;s the free market in that? Didn&rsquo;t we already learn out lesson with monopolies when <a title="Break up of AT&amp;T" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_break_up_of_AT&amp;T" target="_blank">Ma Bell operated this way</a>?</p>

<p>Time Warner says that KXAN gets the spectrum for free, but wants to charge consumers to receive the broadcast. Time Warner really points out that KXAN has the infrastructure in place and wants us to be upset that KXAN would charge for it! Which is ironic because Time Warner already has infrastructure in place and they want us to pay for it. TV stations are making big money because there is no competition and the expensive bit (laying the cable) has already been done. Whenever Time Warner charges me $6 a month for a cable box (on top of $40 for standard cable), I cannot take their complaints seriously; they&rsquo;re both greedy. Stop passing the buck on to the consumer!</p>

<p>Another point that Time Warner makes is that you can watch most NBC shows on <a title="nbc.com" href="http://www.nbc.com" target="_blank">NBC.com</a>. The truth is, you can watch most TV shows online using <a title="Hulu" href="http://www.hulu.com/" target="_blank">Hulu</a>, <a title="YouTubes" href="http://youtube.com" target="_blank">YouTube</a>, or <a title="Azureus = Vuze" href="http://azureus.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">Vuze</a> (to name a few). Set up a <a title="HTPC on Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Htpc" target="_blank">HTPC</a> (home theatre personal computer) and ditch the overpriced, monopolistic cable company altogether!</p>

      <p>After <a title="seth holloway dot com post" href="http://sethholloway.com/blog/?p=144" target="_blank">posting yesterday</a>, I explored the <a title="How We Drive Blog" href="http://www.howwedrive.com/" target="_blank">How We Drive Blog</a> more. There&rsquo;s a <a title="Helmets make you safer?" href="http://www.howwedrive.com/2008/10/01/to-wear-or-not-to-wear-and-is-that-even-the-right-question-ian-walker-on-cycle-helmets/" target="_blank">fascinating article</a> by a research scientist who tried to determine if wearing a helmet makes us safer. The short answer, no one knows.</p>

<p>To summarize, it may actually be better to <strong>not </strong>wear a helmet because people will be more aggressive around you if you are wearing a helmet. Cyclists are also riskier because of a perceived increase in safety. (Psychological research says that monotony and repetition lull us into feeling safe; apply that to cyclists who do everything &ldquo;right&rdquo; and have never been in an accident.) Additionally, most cyclists die with head and chest injuries; no helmet can help your crushed torso.</p>

<p>Arguing for helmet, they will help with slow speed crashes and self-induced falls.</p>

<p>I got a chuckle from this bit: <em>A bicyclist visited their doctor with a damaged knee following a crash. “You should have been wearing a helmet,” says the doctor sternly. “How would that have saved my knee?” replies the cyclist.</em></p>

<p>So, does wearing a helmet make you safer? Hard to say!</p>

      <p>The BBC has a nice piece on <a title="BBC article on how to enjoy the commute" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/7635486.stm" target="_blank">how to enjoy your commute</a> with tips from <a title="how we drive.com" href="http://www.howwedrive.com/" target="_blank">Tom</a> <a title="tom vanderbilt dot com" href="http://www.tomvanderbilt.com/" target="_blank">Vanderbilt</a>, author of <a title="Amazon of Book" href="http://www.amazon.com/Traffic-Drive-What-Says-About/dp/0307264785/" target="_blank">Traffic: Why We Drive the Way We Do (and What It Says About Us)</a>. The article is pretty interesting; it applies to US driving for the most part; some tips are obvious. I would not think much of it, but this morning a furious motorist yelled at four cyclists who went through a stop sign at the same time (me and one other stopped and waited our turn; the other two rode through milliseconds behind me). Right after I cleared the intersection I heard shouting. Whenever I looked back I saw the SUV stopped in the intersection, driver&rsquo;s-side window down, with a guy screaming. Five seconds later, it was done.</p>

<p>The outburst is upsetting because it is the first car-to-bike roadrage that I&rsquo;ve witnessed. Beyond being gratuitous, I&rsquo;m struck that someone was already so upset by 7:45am! Hopefully the irate motorist will read the tips and chill out.</p>

<p>Beyond reducing the roadrage, my suggestion is to enjoy the crisp morning air on a lovely bike ride. Get some exercise while you enjoy nature&mdash;it&rsquo;s nice.</p>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/home-ownership-maybe-not-the-best-idea/">Home ownership&#8230; maybe not the best idea</a></h1>
      <p>I&rsquo;m a big believer in the American dream of home ownership. I&rsquo;d like to have a place to get away from it all and live how I see fit (for example playing the drums naked). With housing prices being what they are, that dream has seemed distant for a few years now. I could afford a house in the suburbs, but a suburb does not satisfy my desires.</p>

<p>Given the financial crisis, particularly talk of overpriced homes, I feel that homes may become more reasonably priced, and I am glad. However, I read a great article on <a title="Renting &gt;&gt; Buying" href="http://realestate.yahoo.com/promo/renting-makes-more-financial-sense-than-homeownership.html" target="_blank">why renting makes more financial sense than owning a home</a>, and I have to reconsider the options. As property values decrease, apartment prices will too. Rent is almost always cheaper than a mortgage, and even more likely to be cheaper than the cost of owning a home (mortgage, taxes, upkeep, increased utility costs, etc). The author notes that the government generates revenues from homes so they want people in homes. Ultimately, he says investing in stocks will provide a better return on investment so your money is better spent on stocks.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s also a handy little <a title="New York Times (sorry if they want you to login)" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/10/business/2007_BUYRENT_GRAPHIC.html" target="_blank">tool to help you</a> decide when to buy vs rent. Based on my current monthly rent and the median home price in Austin, I&rsquo;d do better to rent.</p>

<p>In the end, home ownership (like so many other decisions) is not about logic, it&rsquo;s about emotion. Money lets me do the things that make me happy, so the happiness from owning a house may outweigh the negatives.</p>

      <p>I had an idea for a website that would cover one issue per day. Clean and simple; just one issue per day. The idea came after I got frustrated with the amount of clutter on various news sites, and while there is a lot of overlap, to really keep up with the world you have to visit a number of websites per day. Instead, why not have one thoughtful, easy to read post per day. Intellectuals could meet at the water cooler and discuss the topic. We&rsquo;d gain exposure to important, interesting ideas all through a simple central location.</p>

<p>I never got very far with my project, but Google is doing a similar thing with <a title="Google 10^100" href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2008/09/project-10100.html" target="_blank">their 10<sup>100</sup> campaign</a>. To celebrate 10 years, Google wants to raise as many helpful ideas as possible. Google and CNN are collaborating, so the star power is there; now we just need some good ideas!</p>

      <p>A while back I read about Chi.mp, a site that promises to aggregate personal data and represent you.

<p>This is all part of the shady control of all domain names owned by the Northern Mariana islands (read more at <a title="Wikipedia .mp Domain" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.mp" target="_blank">wikipedia</a>). A crafty business person is trying to make .mp the domain for social networking.</p>

<p>Despite all that, I like the idea of having one portal to myself. That&rsquo;s why I bought the <a title="seth holloway" href="http://www.sethholloway.com" target="_blank">sethholloway.com</a> domain; however, I understand the reasoning for a random person, with or without their own domain, to have an official portal.

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/the-financial-crisis-pt-2/">The Financial Crisis Pt. 2</a></h1>
      <p><a title="The Financial Crisis Pt. 1" href="http://sethholloway.com/blog/?p=137" target="_blank">Yesterday</a> I gave a couple ideas for why America is in a financial crisis. This was on the heels of Wednesday night when we (finally) <a title="Bush addresses the nation about economy" href="http://www.clipsandcomment.com/2008/09/24/transcript-president-bush-address-to-nation-on-us-financial-crisis-september-24-2008/" target="_blank">heard from President Bush</a> who acknowledges the problem by saying,</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span>For more than a decade, a massive amount of money flowed into the United States from investors abroad. </span><span> This large influx of money&hellip; made it easier for Americans to get credit&hellip;</span> <span>there were also some serious negative consequences, particularly in the housing market. Easy credit — combined with the faulty assumption that home values would continue to rise — led to excesses and bad decisions&hellip; Optimism about housing values also led to a boom in home construction. Eventually the number of new houses exceeded the number of people willing to buy them. And with supply exceeding demand, housing prices fell. And this created a problem: Borrowers with adjustable rate mortgages who had been planning to sell or refinance their homes at a higher price were stuck with homes worth less than expected — along with mortgage payments they could not afford. As a result, many mortgage holders began to default.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>Basically, the housing market was overinflated; it crashed, and took everything with it. Bush then goes on to outline a plan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span>Under our proposal, the federal government would put up to $700 billion taxpayer dollars on the line to purchase troubled assets that are clogging the financial system&hellip; markets have lost confidence in mortgage-backed securities, their prices have dropped sharply. Yet the value of many of these assets will likely be higher than their current price, because the vast majority of Americans will ultimately pay off their mortgages. The government is the one institution with the patience and resources to buy these assets at their current low prices and hold them until markets return to normal&hellip; as these assets are sold&hellip; we expect that much, if not all, of the tax dollars we invest will be paid back.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>The way I read it, the government will buy houses that are currently in trouble. Because he is not specific, I don&rsquo;t know how they will really put the money back in the economy. My vote is to give taxpayers the money directly. Anyone with a bad mortgage can pay down their debt, others can buy a home, the rest of us buy like there&rsquo;s no tomorrow and prop up the economy.</p>

<p>My economic stimulus round two is silly, but buying houses seems like a good solution. That way Wall Street is not directly helped; instead, consumers are bailed out and the entire system benefits. I&rsquo;d rather the government control a collection of houses than a few corporations. The government could do a lot of good things with houses or whole neighborhoods:</p>

<ul>
<li>use the homes as government offices,</li>
<li>sell homes to consumers for the amount of back taxes due</li>
<li>give homes to veterans</li>
<li>subsidize housing for teachers</li>
<li>make a block into a military base</li>
</ul>


<p>I am curious to see how the proposed plan will unfold. Ultimately, I think America needs a greater sense of personal responsibility and disincentives for failure. We all bought the bad debt that we did not understand, so we are all in this together. Companies that are in trouble should face the reaper instead of being bailed out.</p>

<p>I have to wonder, if our companies are too large for the government to let them fail, who will save our mammoth government when it fails?</p>
