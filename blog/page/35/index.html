      <p>Last night we watched <a title="Religulous" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0815241/" target="_blank">Religulous</a>, Bill Maher&rsquo;s documentary on religion. While not a cinematic masterpiece or textbook documentary, the movie is really funny and very entertaining. Maher is openly biased the whole time&mdash;he says openly that doubt is his product and no one really knows&mdash;but that did not take away from the experience for me.</p>

<p>The movie brilliantly splices in hilarious clips and displays what Maher is thinking during interviews.These additions are hardly necessary given the cast. Maher managed to find some of the most eccentric religious superheros alive today; for example he talks to a <a title="Jesus AND the Antichrist in one" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Luis_de_Jes%C3%BAs_Miranda" target="_blank">marketing genius</a> who claims to simultaneously be the second coming of Jesus and the Antichrist. (Sadly, the fellow has over 250,000 followers.) He visits the Netherlands where religious tolerance has caused a stir recently; while there Maher also meets a chap who believes in smoking pot (and that&rsquo;s about it) as well as some other interesting figures.</p>

<p>A few interesting points the movie made:</p>

<ul>
<li>16% of Americans claim no religious affiliation, but there is no lobby for these people</li>
<li>Religion is bigoted and unproven: If religion were a private club, it would be shut down or operate in the shadows</li>
<li>Religion has been used to kill millions of people throughout the ages</li>
<li>No one really knows</li>
</ul>


<p>Overall, it was really funny and concludes with a meaningful point.</p>

      <p>I&rsquo;ve been using Internet radio/social music for quite a while now; I didn&rsquo;t think much of it until I noticed a friend using iTunes&#8217; 30 second clips to sample new music. There&rsquo;s no need for that! There are plenty of websites that provide the entire song for free. How do they do it? Some aggregate the plethora of mp3s available online (try searching google for your favorite song + mp3 and you&rsquo;ll see what I mean); others pay royalties for all the songs they offer; others are magick. In any case, you can enjoy the rewards risk-free.</p>

<p>A few examples that offer music for free over the intarwebz are <a title="Last.fm" href="http://www.last.fm/" target="_blank">Last.fm</a> and <a title="Pandora" href="http://www.pandora.com/" target="_blank">Pandora</a>; these are great places to find new music because they&rsquo;ll play/suggest new music based on what you&rsquo;re listening to.</p>

<p>If you know what you want to hear, <a title="imeem" href="http://www.imeem.com/" target="_blank">imeem</a> and <a title="Seeqpod" href="http://www.seeqpod.com/" target="_blank">Seeqpod</a> allow you to create your own playlists. I&rsquo;ve had very good luck finding songs I want to hear (I&rsquo;ve found 90% of songs I search for). imeem even allows you to export the player similar to embedding YouTube videos; here&rsquo;s a sample of a random playlist:</p>

<object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="500" height="400" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="wmode" value="transparent" /><param name="src" value="http://media.imeem.com/pl/amfxhxhZgi/" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="500" height="400" src="http://media.imeem.com/pl/amfxhxhZgi/" wmode="transparent"></embed></object>


<p>Enjoy! And if you have other suggestions, I&rsquo;d love to hear them!</p>

      <p>As I mentioned earlier, <a title="Rock Band 2 is out -- SethHolloway.com" href="http://sethholloway.com/blog/?p=114" target="_blank">Rock Band 2 is out</a>. <a title="Guitar Hero Official Site" href="http://www.guitarhero.com/" target="_blank">Guitar Hero</a>: <a title="Guitar Hero World Tour" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar_Hero_IV" target="_blank">World Tour</a> (a.k.a. Guitar Hero IV) is not far behind. These games are doing extremely well, and I&rsquo;m not surprised. I have fond memories of playing the original <a title="Nintendo Power Pad" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_Pad" target="_blank">Power Pad</a> for Nintendo. I&rsquo;m glad to see a new generation of novel input devices for games because games have really stuck with standard controls for the last 15 years. Sure, there was a <a title="Duck Hunt Gun" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_hunt_gun" target="_blank">Zapper</a>, <a title="Power GLOVES!" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_glove" target="_blank">Power Glove</a>, <a title="Donkey Kong Bongos!" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donkey_Kong_Jungle_Beat" target="_blank">Donkey Kong Bongos</a>, and <a title="DDR" href="http://www.ddrfreak.com/aboutddr.php" target="_blank">DDR</a>, but games have not explored the space until recently. Think of the slew of games for the <a title="App Store" href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/appstore/" target="_blank">iPhone</a>, the Wii, and instrument-driven games&mdash;we&rsquo;ve only seen the tip of the iceberg! Beyond that, research into augmented reality (it&rsquo;s like virtual reality) has come a long way. This is an exciting time for gamers, indeed.</p>

<p>Beyond being a great time for gamers, it&rsquo;s a great time for developers! iPhone developers are doing well, the same could be possible for anyone related to music! There is a huge opportunity for instrument-driven games, but game makers and the RIAA <a title="Activision CEO wants more!" href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20081001/0245102424.shtml" target="_blank">can&rsquo;t determine how to divide the massive profits</a> (Rock band has <a title="21M downloaded songs" href="http://www.streetinsider.com/Press+Releases/MTV+Games,+Harmonix+and+Electronic+Arts+Ship+Rock+Band+2(TM)+for+XBOX+360(R)/3980528.html" target="_blank">over 21M song downloads</a>; Guitar Hero has <a title="10M songs downloaded" href="http://www.joystiq.com/2008/05/02/rock-band-ships-3-million-bundled-units-10-million-songs-down/" target="_blank">over 10M song downloads</a>).</p>

<p>Rock Band/Guitar Hero should take a page from Apple and publish a development kit. This development kit would allow people to put music into a format usable by instrument-driven games. Make it easy for people to create content and let them do the development for you! Hosting is cheap: set up a repository for musicians to submit their transcribed songs into and allow users to access the library; sell advertising, let musicians or the free market determine pricing; split profits.</p>

<p>These platforms are a great way to get your music known! There are opportunities for challenging songs, easy songs, fun party songs and more! Obscure and popular bands alike can profit. And fans would profit too. If the average person could grasp song structure and technical difficulty, it would educate the masses on music, allow more people into the creative process, raise the bar on musicians, and generally be awesome.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d also like to see new games being developed using the existing novel input devices. Now that we have gyros and guitars, innovate on the ways to use the tools. It can be done; <a title="Devil May Cry using Guitar Hero 3 controller" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CREs25IcHAU" target="_blank">check out</a> this kid playing Devil May Cry with the Guitar Hero axe.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s so much possibility! The time is right for novel input devices. Let&rsquo;s hope that content developers, hosting providers, and platform creators can agree on models that are good for the consumer.</p>

      <p>I recently purchased contact lens from <a title="1800Contacts Web Site" href="http://www.1800contacts.com/" target="_blank">1800Contacts</a>. Now, I&rsquo;m trying to submit a claim to my vision insurance, <a title="Super Vision Homepage" href="http://www.superiorvision.com/" target="_blank">Superior Vision</a>. I am frustrated that the only claims options are fax or snail mail! I have no reason to believe that I will not receive my money, but I&rsquo;m frustrated at the lack of options at filing the claim.</p>

<p>Over the past several years I have been asked to fax a form. Everytime, I&rsquo;m left wondering who has a fax machine handy?</p>

<p>Furthermore, when will companies embrace the digital revolution? I&rsquo;ve scanned the receipt and my insurance card, but there&rsquo;s no email address that I can send it to. Using digital methods would save me, the consumer, and the company time and frustration.</p>

<p>Also, if fax machines are still being used widely, why is there not an open standard for email-to-fax machines?</p>

      <p>The election is a month away, and today is the last day you can register to vote! Do it!</p>

<p>While the politicians bicker and blame one another about <a title="Analysis of what really happened" href="http://techdirt.com/articles/20080929/0426042403.shtml" target="_blank">what happened</a>, the rest of us are left holding the bag.

You may be eligible for early voting! <a title="Early Voting Information Center" href="http://earlyvoting.net/states/abslaws.php" target="_blank">The Early Voting Inforation Center</a> is a great resource for determining if you can vote early.</p>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/nbc-off-the-air-at-least-for-time-warner-subscribers-in-austin/">NBC off the air, at least for Time Warner subscribers in Austin</a></h1>
      <p>The local NBC affiliate, <a title="KXAN" href="http://www.kxan.com/" target="_blank">KXAN</a>, is no longer being shown on <a title="Time Warner in Austin" href="http://www.timewarnercable.com/centraltx/" target="_blank">Time Warner</a> cable. Instead of showing the NBC broadcast, Time Warner is airing a <a title="Truth Hurts KXAN" href="http://www.thetruthhurtskxan.com/main.php" target="_blank">one-sided smear campaign</a> that would have consumers believe that KXAN is to blame.</p>

<p>First of all, I don&rsquo;t have a choice in my local cable and internet provider. Despite the fact that <a title="Grande Communications" href="http://www.grandecom.com/" target="_blank">Grande Communications</a> offers great deals all around me, I can only use Time Warner. In the past five apartments I&rsquo;ve lived in, I had no choice. The cable companies offer their product at a price and the consumer has to take it or leave it. Where&rsquo;s the free market in that? Didn&rsquo;t we already learn out lesson with monopolies when <a title="Break up of AT&amp;T" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_break_up_of_AT&amp;T" target="_blank">Ma Bell operated this way</a>?</p>

<p>Time Warner says that KXAN gets the spectrum for free, but wants to charge consumers to receive the broadcast. Time Warner really points out that KXAN has the infrastructure in place and wants us to be upset that KXAN would charge for it! Which is ironic because Time Warner already has infrastructure in place and they want us to pay for it. TV stations are making big money because there is no competition and the expensive bit (laying the cable) has already been done. Whenever Time Warner charges me $6 a month for a cable box (on top of $40 for standard cable), I cannot take their complaints seriously; they&rsquo;re both greedy. Stop passing the buck on to the consumer!</p>

<p>Another point that Time Warner makes is that you can watch most NBC shows on <a title="nbc.com" href="http://www.nbc.com" target="_blank">NBC.com</a>. The truth is, you can watch most TV shows online using <a title="Hulu" href="http://www.hulu.com/" target="_blank">Hulu</a>, <a title="YouTubes" href="http://youtube.com" target="_blank">YouTube</a>, or <a title="Azureus = Vuze" href="http://azureus.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">Vuze</a> (to name a few). Set up a <a title="HTPC on Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Htpc" target="_blank">HTPC</a> (home theatre personal computer) and ditch the overpriced, monopolistic cable company altogether!</p>

      <p>After <a title="seth holloway dot com post" href="http://sethholloway.com/blog/?p=144" target="_blank">posting yesterday</a>, I explored the <a title="How We Drive Blog" href="http://www.howwedrive.com/" target="_blank">How We Drive Blog</a> more. There&rsquo;s a <a title="Helmets make you safer?" href="http://www.howwedrive.com/2008/10/01/to-wear-or-not-to-wear-and-is-that-even-the-right-question-ian-walker-on-cycle-helmets/" target="_blank">fascinating article</a> by a research scientist who tried to determine if wearing a helmet makes us safer. The short answer, no one knows.</p>

<p>To summarize, it may actually be better to <strong>not </strong>wear a helmet because people will be more aggressive around you if you are wearing a helmet. Cyclists are also riskier because of a perceived increase in safety. (Psychological research says that monotony and repetition lull us into feeling safe; apply that to cyclists who do everything &ldquo;right&rdquo; and have never been in an accident.) Additionally, most cyclists die with head and chest injuries; no helmet can help your crushed torso.</p>

<p>Arguing for helmet, they will help with slow speed crashes and self-induced falls.</p>

<p>I got a chuckle from this bit: <em>A bicyclist visited their doctor with a damaged knee following a crash. “You should have been wearing a helmet,” says the doctor sternly. “How would that have saved my knee?” replies the cyclist.</em></p>

<p>So, does wearing a helmet make you safer? Hard to say!</p>

      <p>The BBC has a nice piece on <a title="BBC article on how to enjoy the commute" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/7635486.stm" target="_blank">how to enjoy your commute</a> with tips from <a title="how we drive.com" href="http://www.howwedrive.com/" target="_blank">Tom</a> <a title="tom vanderbilt dot com" href="http://www.tomvanderbilt.com/" target="_blank">Vanderbilt</a>, author of <a title="Amazon of Book" href="http://www.amazon.com/Traffic-Drive-What-Says-About/dp/0307264785/" target="_blank">Traffic: Why We Drive the Way We Do (and What It Says About Us)</a>. The article is pretty interesting; it applies to US driving for the most part; some tips are obvious. I would not think much of it, but this morning a furious motorist yelled at four cyclists who went through a stop sign at the same time (me and one other stopped and waited our turn; the other two rode through milliseconds behind me). Right after I cleared the intersection I heard shouting. Whenever I looked back I saw the SUV stopped in the intersection, driver&rsquo;s-side window down, with a guy screaming. Five seconds later, it was done.</p>

<p>The outburst is upsetting because it is the first car-to-bike roadrage that I&rsquo;ve witnessed. Beyond being gratuitous, I&rsquo;m struck that someone was already so upset by 7:45am! Hopefully the irate motorist will read the tips and chill out.</p>

<p>Beyond reducing the roadrage, my suggestion is to enjoy the crisp morning air on a lovely bike ride. Get some exercise while you enjoy nature&mdash;it&rsquo;s nice.</p>
