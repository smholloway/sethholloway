      <p>The Internet community had some great pranks this April Fools. I was reminded that the world is incredibly well-connected when I noticed a few foreign sites were down. Being 10pm here, I thought nothing of it. Minutes later my friend reminded me that it was April Fools some places&hellip;</p>

<p>On the home front, Google had a few funny pranks, namely Virgle and Gmail custom time. Actually, I think these are both good ideas. If only we had a few days a year to pitch ideas and roll them back when they&rsquo;re not well received&hellip; Youtube was also hilarious by Rick Rolling us all. No guarantees, but for now I say &ldquo;I&rsquo;m never gonna let you go!&rdquo;</p>

<p>If I put a link <a title="clicky" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBGIQ7ZuuiU">here</a>, will you click it? Good! Good.</p>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/radiohead-is-not-the-best-band-ever/">Radiohead is not the best band ever</a></h1>
      <p>I don&rsquo;t know who the best band ever is, but it is not Radiohead.</p>

<p>For those of you who agree, you rock.</p>

<p>For those of you disagree, I&rsquo;m glad I&rsquo;m not you.</p>

<p>For those of you who have no idea what this is about, allow me to provide some context. This weekend I met an Austin musician and all-around cool fellow, Chris. Among other topics we reminisced about the days of yore, that old timey rock and roll, and modern technologies that can empower listeners. Since I was in the dorms, life has changed dramatically&mdash;at least for music downloads. In 2001 there was no such thing as iTunes. There was a dying Napster, a fledling replacement called Kazaa, and a slew of other P2P programs vying for our attention. No matter where your loyalties laid or lie, the end result was the same: music on demand. Livin&#8217; was easy as the downloads flowed harmlessly. I discovered over 100 new artists in a year of perusing other&rsquo;s music collections, and I&rsquo;d like to think I exposed other hapless youngsters to their new fleeting favorites.</p>

<p>But times are very different now. The association-that-shall-not-be-named ruined things with questionable attacks on society&rsquo;s most hardened criminals (college kids, tweens, and grandmothers to name a few). Since launching a campaign against their customers, the association-that-shall-not-be-named found that sales decreased; a fact that can only be remedied with further attacks. As reasonable and high-tech as this approach was, it was not very effective. Fans revolted. Bands revolted. And now it is early 2008. A number of famous bands are releasing their music through their own sites. David Byrne describes the changing industry more eloquently than I could ever hope to, so read <a title="David Byrne strategies for artists" href="http://www.wired.com/entertainment/music/magazine/16-01/ff_byrne" target="_blank">this article</a> if you want to know more.</p>

<p>And now you&rsquo;re in the know, so we get back to the bench where Chris and I are conversing. Radiohead put out their latest album, In Rainbows, online. Even more revolutionary is their pay-what-you-think-its-worth strategy. After a few weeks of independent sales, Radiohead made more money than they would have under a record label. While this was really cool, and I completely support the musical revolution, I do not think that Radiohead is the best band ever.</p>

<p>Still not following? Google for &ldquo;best band ever&rdquo; or &ldquo;critical darling&rdquo; and you should see Radiohead littering the landscape. If you&rsquo;re still confused, talk to any hip music buff under the age of 35 and you will be regaled with tales of the greatest band in the world, Radiohead.</p>

      <p>One of my goals in purchasing <a title="official site of seth holloway, duh" href="http://www.sethholloway.com">sethholloway.com</a> is to carve out my own niche on the Internet superhighway&mdash;the series of tubes invented by a politician from Tin-uh-see. However, as I google myself (which is even dirtier than it sounds) I can&rsquo;t help but feel that my job is not yet done. Many of my friends and peers have amazingly unique names, for example &ldquo;Jason&rdquo; or &ldquo;Steve,&rdquo; yet they are the top search results when you search for them!</p>

<p>All my life I thought I was unique. I recently discovered that everybody poops and more than two people per city are named Seth. Unfortunately for me, &ldquo;Seth Holloway&rdquo; is more popular statistically than &ldquo;Seth &lt;any other last name&gt;&rdquo; and as a result, there are a lot more Seth Holloways out there than I realized. But you know what? I&rsquo;m the only one with <a title="official site of seth holloway, duh" href="http://www.sethholloway.com">www.sethholloway.com</a>! :-p</p>

<p>If you, fair visitor, are another Seth Holloway please create <a title="official site of seth holloways, duh" href="http://sethholloways.com">sethholloways.com</a> so we can differentiate ourselves. If you are looking for another Seth Holloway, I wish you luck on your quest.</p>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/dogs-in-public/">Dogs in public</a></h1>
      <p>A few of the inappropriate places I&rsquo;ve seen dogs in the past two weeks: a home improvement store, the grocery store, and a coffee shop. I imagine there were other locations that I blocked out.</p>

<p>Dogs are cute. Few people will deny that; however, dogs in public can be really obnoxious. Dirty paws on the table, wet noses on hands, bodies against people, droppings on the floor. Then you have the pet owners that treat Fluffy like their best friend, or worse yet, their baby. No wonder dogs have anxiety disorders&hellip;</p>

<p>I think what this boils down to is jealousy. I desire to be carted around, all day every day, in someone&rsquo;s purse. My knees are bloody and my arms tired from falling to the ground and shaking my fists skyward as I curse my lot in life&mdash;6 foot tall and unable to fit in a purse!</p>
