      <p>Do we need AV software? It is naive to think that safe practices will protect you&mdash;there are simply too many ways to get into a system. You need something to protect your computer, and good AV software won&rsquo;t hurt.</p>

<p>I was reading a lifehacker article <a title="Lifehacker: Do you use AV software?" href="http://lifehacker.com/384147/do-you-run-antivirus-software?cpage=2" target="_blank">asking readers about antivirus (AV) software</a>. The range of knowledge conveyed in the comments is ridiculous. Some users claimed they never had a virus. There are known botnets with over a million machines. I doubt that all million machines are owned by a single individual, which means there are multiple users who are either willingly allowing someone to use their machine, or the multiple users are unaware of the heist. With the sophistication of modern viruses (rootkits, automatic replication, dynamic signature changing, etc), it is silly to claim you would even know if you had a virus.</p>

<p>A couple users claim that there had never been a virus for Linux. I don&rsquo;t even know where to start on that one. Definitely false. Any script kiddie could gain access to a Linux system that had not been hardened. There are a number of measures a system administrator can take to mitigate threats on Linux, but not every Linux user is a sys admin. Services like ssh being on by default increase the risks greatly. The power of a Linux command line and access to powerful development tools make subsequent attacks easier to launch.</p>

<p>People seem to define virus strangely. Some viruses like vundo trigger a lot of pop-ups, but won&rsquo;t necessarily crater your system. Other viruses that do not brick your machine are passively collecting information, waiting for further instructions, or launching attacks. You don&rsquo;t even have to open a file to be at risk. You don&rsquo;t even have to be online; infected USB keys (and other input devices) can infect a computer that isn&rsquo;t online.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not just dumb users either. Viruses come from your friends and people you trust. Elaborate social networking hoaxes are being performed everyday, and everyday they get more convincing. Malware distributors have some of the most professional websites online. Their UI and interface design mimic trusted providers so a quick glance will not immediately reveal a problem. You have to realize and appreciate the ingenuity of the nefarious Internet warriors&mdash;they&rsquo;re smart, creative, and talented.</p>

<p>Comparisons have shown that no one piece of antivirus software will catch all viruses, so your best bet is to</p>

<p>1) be safe:</p>

<ul>
<li>Don&rsquo;t open links in emails. Type the URL into the address bar on your own.</li>
<li>Be mindful of what your friends are sending you. Would Suzy really send you a link to get rich quick?</li>
<li>Avoid the worst of the web (pornography, gambling, warez)</li>
</ul>


<p>and 2) run a few different tools:</p>

<ul>
<li><a title="AVG Free" href="http://free.avg.com/download-avg-anti-virus-free-edition" target="_blank">AVG</a> (or <a title="avast! Home Edition (free)" href="http://www.avast.com/eng/download-avast-home.html" target="_blank">avast!</a>) &ndash; Antivirus</li>
<li><a title="Peer Guardian 2" href="http://phoenixlabs.org/pg2/" target="_blank">PeerGuardian 2</a> &ndash; IP Blocker</li>
<li><a title="Ad-Aware" href="http://www.lavasoft.com/products/ad_aware_free.php" target="_blank">Ad-Aware</a> &ndash; Antispyware</li>
</ul>


<p>So do we need AV software? Yes. You can never be totally safe, but you can mitigate your risks. Use common sense, a few tools, and perform frequent backups. Good luck!</p>

      <p>As the semester draws to an end, I am pleased with the progress of the <a title="Students in Software Engineering" href="http://www.edge.utexas.edu/sse/" target="_blank">Students in Software Engineering</a>.  Leading the group has been a very rewarding experience for me, and participating has been great! I enjoyed learning more about my peers&#8217; research as well as hearing some of the professors&#8217; thoughts.</p>

<p>Here are a few statistics from our inaugural semester:</p>

<ul>
<li>Meetings averaged 16 students</li>
<li>We averaged a turnout of over 50% of our target audience (Software Engineering graduate students)</li>
<li>Over 100 different people came to at least one meeting</li>
<li>Hosted the Chairman of the department</li>
<li>We filled the room for two meetings</li>
<li>There were never any donuts left</li>
</ul>


<p>I&rsquo;m very proud to be part of the Students in Software Engineering. The organization has done a phenomenal job of uniting Software Engineers, and we will continue to foster the collaborative, friendly environment. Coming next semester:</p>

<ul>
<li>Greater in-person promotion</li>
<li>Meeting format change: three student presentation (reading groups) and one large meeting per month</li>
<li>A new website</li>
<li>SSE goodies</li>
<li>A few other surprises :)</li>
</ul>


<p>None of this would be possible without the awesome community of students in Software Engineering and my hardworking officers: Justin Enderle, Dave DeAngelis, and Robert Grant. Thanks to you all!</p>

      <p>Do simple minds lead to healthy bodies? Animals are simpler than humans, and their physical abilities are incredible. In general, animals are lean and strong while humans are trending towards&hellip; well, not lean and strong :)</p>

<p>I make money using my brain, not my brawn. My thought-intensive labor pays well, and I use the pay for food&mdash;among other needs and wants. I don&rsquo;t use my body to obtain food, and I don&rsquo;t use my body to get paid; that means I have to consciously exercise this human machine. At the same time, food is easily accessible. Add to this reality the fact that <a title="Does thinking make us fat? Yep." href="http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/SmartHome/story?id=5763150&amp;page=1" target="_blank">thinking makes us fat</a> (because the act uses glucose which destabilizes insulin levels and makes us hungry).</p>

<p>On the other hand, dogs do not have to work nor hunt for food, yet they are fit. Dogs live to run around. You can throw the ball forever, and they will continue to go full tilt, retrieve, return, and repeat. Their simple minds think chasing a ball is the best thing ever, and they don&rsquo;t see it as exercise.</p>

<p>Children are the same way. No, I&rsquo;m not calling your child a dog. However, children are simpler than adults and gleefully play all day. To simpler kinds, exercise seems to come easily: it is not necessary, it is not a chore, it is fun. We should approach exercise as children do. Find something active that you like, and do it. It is play. It is unstructured. They simply have too much energy and want to get rid of it. How can we do the same?</p>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/what-is-up-with-network-tv/">What is up with network TV?</a></h1>
      <p>What is up with network TV? Jay Leno is getting an hour during prime time and reality shows are everywhere. NBC.com receives less visitors than Hulu.com and neither can compete with the amount of downloaded shows. The previous business models for televsion are gone.</p>

<p>When you boil it down, TV exists to sell advertisements. Without ads, shows receive no funding and cannot be produced. More to the point, shows will not be produced for large networks that require hefty sums of money to support themselves. There are popular shows on the Internet that are written, produced, and directed by aspiring actors and/or everyday people. One route to making money off these shows is to sell show-themed merchandise (for example, see <a title="Red Vs Blue" href="http://rvb.roosterteeth.com/home.php" target="_blank">Red Vs Blue</a> and <a title="Red Vs Blue Merchandise" href="http://www.roosterteethstore.com/" target="_blank">their store</a>). The world is still exploring other ideas, but we&rsquo;re likely to see entertainers (I&rsquo;m thinking musicians, but comedians and athletes come to mind too) exploring new avenues for making money. I predict larger overall audiences who are split between countless niches.</p>

<p>So what got me thinking about all this? One night <a title="Andrea Holloway" href="http://www.facebook.com/people/Andrea-Holloway/90900316#/profile.php?id=7920921" target="_blank">Andrea</a> and I were watching TV; we flipped through the channels and found two amazing (amazing &ndash; <em>adjective: </em>So remarkable as to elicit disbelief) shows on network TV: <em>Hole in the Wall</em> and <em>Wipeout</em>. Because they were playing at the same time, we only saw bits of each.</p>

<p>With <em>Hole in the Wall</em> you get sweet foam cut-outs meandering down a track at goofy, leotard-wearing, wannabe-reality-show stars; when the contestants cannot contort their bodies to the silly shape, they are swept into a pool and rescued by a beefy guy and a voluptuous woman while the other team heckles them. Think American Gladiators without any physical strength requirement or possible danger. Here&rsquo;s a clip of the original, Japanese (of course) version of the show:</p>

<object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="425" height="344" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/OMVr4BjkrVU&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="344" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/OMVr4BjkrVU&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object>


<p>Changing the channel we find <em>Wipeout</em> where a fake torrential rain is supposedly pounding contestants who run an obstacle course that is straight out of <em>MXC</em>. <em>MXC</em> has hilarious commentary and does not take itself seriously. Wipeout, on the other hand, has no positives.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m left wondering what is up with network TV? I guess these two shows are cheap to produce and garner enough audience attention to turn a profit. Goodonya! but I&rsquo;ll take my attention elsewhere.</p>

      <p>Automakers should make cars like we make computers.</p>

<p>The US automakers are in trouble. Last week the government agreed to help the big 3 out with $15B. Today, <a title="Should we save Detroit?" href="http://michaelboatright.com/?p=26" target="_blank">Mike commented on the auto industry bailout</a>, expressing an opinion I share for the most part (we should not save Detroit). Americans have voted with their dollars: they do not want American cars. For years the automotive industry has received subsidies for innovation; at this point it seems they frittered the money away. I think auto makers should follow the computer industry. As it stands automobiles are still crafted when they need to be manufactured.</p>

<p>A classic example of craftsmanship versus engineering is in gun production. Before the Industrial Revolution, people handmade every piece of a gun, meticulously massaging the metal and wood until everything fit. Then we specialized in making specific components very uniformly. With uniform components anyone could order the right pieces and assemble a gun.</p>

<p>The computer industry was in a similar position years ago. No, not bankruptcy, but auto makers were not doing well either; they were trying to accommodate myriad different components that led to countless different combinations (many did not work). As <a title="Ryan Harvey on Twitter" href="http://twitter.com/utharvey" target="_blank">Ryan Harvey</a> <a title="I want a hackintosh -- comments" href="http://sethholloway.com/blog/?p=142" target="_blank">commented in my post about Macs</a>, controlling the hardware removes a lot of headaches for anyone sitting above the foundation&mdash;Macs &ldquo;just work&rdquo; in part because they only support a handful of configuration works. However, AMD and Intel have both made their processors more standard (fitting a standard socket) which has led to 1) ease in building computers and 2) innovation in motherboards, graphics cards, and even CPUs. Whenever the hardware works, others can focus on higher layers.</p>

<p>Dell made a killing as a computer-builder without making any of their own parts. They bought components from companies who specialized in those components and produced inexpensive. In the meantime we saw many other companies follow a similar business model and do well. At the same time, hobbyists benefited from the reduced prices and increased technology. Car makers could follow the same arc to everyone&rsquo;s benefit.</p>

<p>The automakers should make cars like we make computers:</p>

<ul>
<li>Define the basic car components.</li>
<li>Make car parts more standard and interoperable.</li>
<li>Create new jobs creating parts, assembling vehicles, modifying cars and car parts, and researching new components.</li>
<li>Offer people premade vehicles at a discount or allow them to customize their components at a premium.</li>
</ul>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/america-needs-to-harden-its-cyber-security/">America needs to harden its cyber security</a></h1>
      <p>Business Week has a nice <a title="Business Week article" href="http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/content/dec2008/db2008127_817606.htm?campaign_id=rss_daily   " target="_blank">article on how the US is falling behind in cyber security</a>. It&rsquo;s remarkably apropos after a couple high profile security stories earlier this year: <a title="viruses were discovered on Space Station computers infected" href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn14628?feedId=online-news_rss20" target="_blank">computers on the International Space Station</a> and an Iranian IT worker was <a title="Iranian man executed for cybercrime" href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/middle_east/article5258057.ece" target="_blank">executed after being found out as a spy</a>. Are there viruses on US government computers on land? Do we have spies working in our governmental IT department? The answer to both questions is likely yes, so what are we doing about it?</p>

<p>Computers are used for everything! Unfortunately, America is falling behind in security research and, more importantly, countermeasures. I am glad to see the recommendations for President-Elect Obama; I just hope Obama takes the threat to heart and hardens America&rsquo;s cyber security. If we do not, no amount of firepower will protect us from attackers controlling our computers that are controlling the bombs.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>Michael Masnick over at Techdirt <a title="Techdirty" href="http://techdirt.com/articles/20081208/1142253055.shtml" target="_blank">pointed at that everyone knows we need better security</a> and asks what we should do? To start, fund serious research into security. Establish courses on security in schools nationwide so that students can keep up with trends, and learn how to do things properly. Next, allow hobbyists a way to polish their skills within fear of being thrown in jail. Increase the number of jobs in cyber security and take cyber threats seriously. With the education in place and the government in line, we need to harden individuals machines. The government can (help) develop and promote helpful software: firewalls, antivirus, antispam, and intrusion protection applications. Allow Microsoft a one-time ability to patch all users systems and subsidize the operation if need be. Finally, increase the punishment for people operate outside the framework or who pass the buck (posting links to infected sites).</p>

      <p>It&rsquo;s always exciting to read sci-fi novels and discover what the future could look like. Sci-fi movies show it even more vividly. Minority Report has a futuristic gesture-based user interface that looks cool, but I&rsquo;m not sure I would use it well :)</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of space between the Minority Report style and our current interfaces. Research will get us there one day, but in the meantime I would love a user interface where I could simultaneously view arbitrarily many modules (web pages, documents, games, etc.) or submodules (pieces of those things). Each (sub)module could be closed, moved, and resized: think of  iPhone-like controls on all your browser tabs. Windows Alt-Tab preview as well as browsers tab previews are a step in the right direction, but you ultimately choose only one module at a time. Mashups  (iGoogle for example) offered are a promising path to achieving this, but I still have not seen dynamically-sized, dynamically-loaded, swappable modules.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve got the technology, please let me know. If not, create it and send me a link to buy it!</p>

      <p>I have felt a general <a title="Please your customers!" href="http://sethholloway.com/blog/?p=444" target="_blank">lack of love from companies recently</a>. Last night, after 7 hours of calling Japan Airlines and Vayama, I got a full refund on my now-cancelled honeymoon to Thailand. For those keeping track, I&rsquo;m two for two on my customer service battles. I&rsquo;m overjoyed at the outcome, but I remain greatly frustrated by the experience.</p>

<p>This morning I was thinking about truly pleasing customer service experiences. Sadly, the only one I thought of was a trip to <a title="Whataburger" href="http://whataburger.com/" target="_blank">Whataburger</a> where they charged me for two meals when I only ordered one. I told the employee the situation and she immediately swiped my card and refunded me the $5 with no questions asked and no excuses. Needless to say, I love <a title="Whataburger commercial" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiSqEadjYhk" target="_blank">Whataburger</a> and continue to destroy their #11 breakfast combo (in moderation) :)</p>

<p>Reflecting now I wonder 1) Have I really had so few positive customer service experiences? 2) Why can Whataburger help me immediately when other companies can&rsquo;t or won&rsquo;t? 3) Is service better in a culture where tradition and the greater good are important (i.e. Asia)?</p>

<p>Anyone else have experiences (positive or negative) they want to share?</p>
