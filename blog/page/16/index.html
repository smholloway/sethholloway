      <p>Blind and visually impaired people will never use the Internet like sighted people. It&rsquo;s not fair, but it&rsquo;s true. If it makes you feel better, visually impaired people have text read to them at 400+ words per minute (about three times faster than the rest of us). Making the web accessible is not easy, nor does it seem economically feasible when only 2.6% of the population is effected (that&rsquo;s <a title="Wikipedia: Blindness:Epidemiology" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blindness#Epidemiology" target="_blank">161 million people worldwide</a>). For those unconvinced that hundreds of extra hours of development and testing is worthwhile, consider the true economic value: search engine optimization (SEO). It turns out that simple accessibility changes also lead to higher PageRank, probably because web crawlers are blind. So dress up your images, links, and videos: you&rsquo;ll make your site easier to find and easier to read.</p>

      <p>People complain a lot about being under-appreciated. I think this is because good people do not necessarily stand out. It is often true that the squeaky wheel gets the grease. After some pondering, I believe that it is actually the people that require the least thought from a boss that are the best workers. The best compliment you can give someone is then that you don&rsquo;t have to worry about them. They allow your mind to be free so you can pursue more important or pleasurable thoughts. Take a moment to think about the people that you don&rsquo;t have to think about&mdash;the friend you can call anytime, the customer that always pays on time, the boss that stays out of your hair&mdash;now, thank them.</p>

      <p>TL;DR: check CustomUrl and SitesMappings.</p>

<p>Andrea is hosting her domain, <a title="Andrea Mire Holloway" href="http://www.andreamholloway.com/">andreamholloway.com</a>, on Google Sites. This is yet another great (free) service from Google; however, as with all Google products, you have to find your own way around. For weeks her site was only accessible via the funky, internal Google Sites address (<a href="https://sites.google.com/a/andreamholloway.com/www/">https://sites.google.com/a/andreamholloway.com/www/</a>)&mdash;hardly the address you want to share.</p>

<p>We googled for all kinds of keywords with no success. I believe this is a language problem at the core and the problem is particularly difficult because of jargon like DNS, CNAME, ANAME, route, address, URL, site, etc.</p>

<p>In the end, Google has made the process pretty simple. I believe you should only need to check three things</p>

<p>1. Ensure that you are not routing your site administrator/user access to www.&lt;your_domain&gt;
<a href="https://www.google.com/a/cpanel/YOUR_DOMAIN/CustomUrl" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.google.com/a/cpanel/YOUR_DOMAIN/CustomUrl">https://www.google.com/a/cpanel/YOUR_DOMAIN/CustomUrl</a></a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.google.com/a/cpanel/YOUR_DOMAIN/CustomUrl" target="_blank"></a>Leave your CustomUrl as the default (something like <a href="https://www.google.com/a/cpanel/yourdomain.com/">https://www.google.com/a/cpanel/yourdomain.com/</a>)</p>

<p>In this case &lt;your_domain&gt; is the domain you bought.</p>

<ol>
<li>In your SitesMappings, map your Google Site to www.yourdomain.com</li>
</ol>


<p><a href="https://www.google.com/a/cpanel/YOUR_DOMAIN/SitesMappings" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.google.com/a/cpanel/YOUR_DOMAIN/SitesMappings">https://www.google.com/a/cpanel/YOUR_DOMAIN/SitesMappings</a></a>
Add a new web address
Site Location<em>
[www]
Web Address</em>
[www]
Click &ldquo;Add mapping&rdquo; button</p>

<p>3. Map the naked domain (yourdomain.com without the www preceding) to www.yourdomain.com</p>

<p>If you did not purchase your domain through Google Sites, you may need to adjust the DNS settings. You&rsquo;ll need to Google around for the right settings, but you will see a lot of ghs.google.com.</p>

<p>For more, I&rsquo;d recommend you checkout Steegle&rsquo;s guide available <a title="Steegle's Google Sites How-to" href="http://www.steegle.com/websites/google-sites-howtos/googlesites-frequentlyaskedquestionsfaq">here</a>.</p>

<p>I hope this information helps others&mdash;I know I spent too much time trying to figure it out myself.</p>

      <p>The United States provides <a title="US Census aid numbers" href="http://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/cats/foreign_commerce_aid/foreign_aid.html" target="_blank">billions of dollars of aid to foreign nations every year</a>. It is questionable whether or not the aid is truly helping the people and if recipients are grateful for the assistance. For example, <a title="Why U.S. Farm Subsidies Are Bad for the World" href="http://www.commondreams.org/views02/0506-09.htm">some say</a> that giving food to agricultural nations actually reduces their ability to make money and improve themselves.</p>

<p>Rather than debate the current structure, why don&rsquo;t we use that money to fund trips abroad? American teens could have a federally funded <a title="Wikipedia: Gap Year" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gap_year">gap year</a>. As these travelers spend, they generate new jobs and bring up the people in the nations they visit. They might also gain some perspective and change the attitude that we&rsquo;re Ugly Americans.</p>

<p>What do you think, best idea ever? :)</p>

<p>For a glimpse at one can happen when you distribute food to hungry people check out the <a title="Anthony Bourdain No Reservations 10m in" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6gmB-jYd-c#at=600">No Reservations Haiti episode (10 minutes in)</a>.</p>

      <p>Preface: I&rsquo;m not hurt and the situation is now resolved. Earlier this semester I was hit by a car while riding my bike home, and it sucked.</p>

<p>I stopped at a four-way stop that&rsquo;s less than half a mile from my house. I look around before proceeding and all I see is a car maybe one hundred feet down the street to my right&mdash;plenty of time to stop. So I scoot through the intersection and as I&rsquo;m almost out I notice something peculiar out of the corner of my eye: the car is not stopping. I instinctively picked up my feet and then felt my bike jerk violently. My feet slammed down on the pavement and I was stunned.</p>

<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-1150" title="Back Tire After Getting Hit" src="/images/bike-wreck.jpg" alt="Back Tire After Getting Hit" width="300" height="224" /></p>

<p>A couple other cars went through the intersection and the guy that hit me kept rolling. I dropped my bike and pulled out my phone so I could call 911 and snap a picture of the perp. Just then he stopped. I ran over with no clear purpose, then thought better of it and stopped to call my wife and the police. The guy comes over and apologizes, but I wasn&rsquo;t having any of it. When the cop arrived the driver was ticketed and we exchanged information. From there, <a title="Progressive Insurance" href="http://www.progressive.com/">Progressive</a> and the <a title="The Peddler Bike shop" href="http://www.peddlerbike.com/">Peddler</a> got me sorted out.</p>

<p>Getting hit by a car sucks, but virtually every biker I talked to about it had a similar war story. It&rsquo;s a shame. Be safe out there cyclists!</p>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/wheres-the-innovation-in-elevators/">Where&#8217;s the innovation in elevators?</a></h1>
      <p>I have to preface this by admitting that I live in <a title="Wikipedia: Tallest Buildings in Austin" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tallest_buildings_in_Austin">a short city</a>. Our skyscrapers now pass 50 stories, but for a long time we were around 30 stories and those buildings were rare. I cannot recall a time I rode an elevator above eight stories in Austin, so I&rsquo;m not an elevator expert. With that in mind, I have to wonder where is the innovation in elevators? I rode an express elevator in Chicago that only stopped at the top floor or bottom floor. That&rsquo;s a start, but what about the other 90 floors?</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a <a title="Vertical Transportation Handbook on Google" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=GLZdcTVI4kIC&amp;lpg=PA102&amp;ots=fsVe2fbXaN&amp;dq=elevators%20stop%20odd%20numbers&amp;pg=PA102#v=onepage&amp;q=elevators%20stop%20odd%20numbers&amp;f=false">Vertical Transportation Handbook</a> that details the theory behind elevators and optimum stop values, but I couldn&rsquo;t find anything as innovative as <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9Ig19gYP9o" target="_blank">the train that never stops</a>.</p>

<p>The train that never stops could probably be adapted to vertical transportation, but I&rsquo;m not excited about beta testing that one :)</p>

<p>We could borrow ideas from public transportation and have long-haul elevators that stop infrequently (like a train) then people move to a secondary elevator for shorter rides (like a bus). For example, let&rsquo;s say you want to get to the 19th floor. You&rsquo;d hop in the elevator, press [your desired floor/10] 2 then zip up to the 20th floor. From there you walk down a flight of stairs or take an elevator that only goes from 15 to 25.</p>

<p>Another idea is to stop at half floors. Want to go to 20? Get off at 19.5 and walk up a ramp (ADA compliant, woot!). This would eliminate half the stops without sacrificing convenience. This is more convenient than schemes that stop at only odd or even number floors.</p>

<p>How about elevators that open on multiple sides? You could then put elevators in the middle of a building and let people exit, for example, to the east or west.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d love to have slides and fireman poles for quick descents, but that doesn&rsquo;t solve the ascent issue&hellip;</p>

<p>So, what am I missing? Are there better ideas out there? How are people <a href="http://ph.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20100326094348AAVnkXO" target="_blank">traversing vertical cities these days</a>?</p>

      <p>.svnignore is my attempt to create the equivalent of .gitignore. After creating the file I had to set the svn:ignore property before it worked:
<code>svn propset svn:ignore -F .svnignore .</code></p>

<p>First, a little background: my PhD work uses <a title="Sun SPOT World" href="http://www.sunspotworld.com/">Sun (Oracle) SPOT devices</a> that run the <a title="Squawk VM" href="http://www.research.sun.com/projects/squawk/index.html">Java Squawk VM</a> (kinda like <a title="Wikipedia: Java Micro Edition" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Platform,_Micro_Edition">Java ME</a>). For version control, we use <a title="Subversion" href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a>. In keeping with good version control practices, I want to avoid putting binary and compiled files into version control. The easiest way to do this is a solid .svnignore file. I spent a few minutes trying to find a .svnignore example for Java and could not find anything, so I built one myself based on several examples I saw.</p>

<p>.svnignore</p>

<blockquote>
    *.class
    build/*
    j2meclasses/*
    .classpath
    .project
    .settings
    *.war
    *~
    *.lock
    *.DS_Store
    *.swp
    *.out
    *.bak
    *.tmp
    *.log
    log*.txt
    .idea
    .git
</blockquote>


<p>From the top, ignore class files, the build directory, the classes directory, our local classpath/project/settings, the compiled deployment package (WAR/JAR), any tilde backup files, a OS X specific directory,  VI files that are being edited, log files, backup and temporary files, IDE files (thanks <a title="Lane Holloway is awesome" href="http://www.laneholloway.com/">Lane</a>), and finally any git files (this part could be expanded to include other version control systems like Bazaar or Mercurial).</p>

<p>If I missed something, please let me know.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>GitHub has published a list of .gitignore files for a number of languages: <a title="GitHub's gitignore files" href="https://github.com/github/gitignore"><a href="https://github.com/github/gitignore">https://github.com/github/gitignore</a></a>. You can pop these into your .svnignore and apply the properties.</p>

      <p>Yesterday I heard a commercial for Time Warner Cable. They were advertising their cable/Internet bundles and named a price only to add a caveat that this price was for new subscribers only. This comes after I get a letter detailing Time Warner&rsquo;s impending price hike. It would feel great to exclaim, &ldquo;I like Time Warner! They&rsquo;ve treated me right and kept my rates fair.&rdquo; Instead, I say, &ldquo;I chose Time Warner because I don&rsquo;t have any other real options and their introductory rate was competitive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This is just one example. We&rsquo;ve created a culture of &ldquo;abandon ship&rdquo; instead of long-term brand relationships. Why don&rsquo;t companies use loyalty rates instead of special introductory pricing? Now, as I  look for new service providers, I am wooed by long-term savings rather than asterisk riddled short-term deals.</p>

<p>I sense that the pendulum is swinging and companies with outstanding customer support will prosper. As that happens, I hope consumers are rewarded for picking a company and sticking with them. Props to insurance and car companies for being some of the first to adopt this model.</p>
