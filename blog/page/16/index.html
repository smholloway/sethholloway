      <p>Everyday, millions of people fly. I&rsquo;d guess most everyone hates the process. As with most things in life, happy people make everything better (they&rsquo;re more productive, etc)&ndash;and it&rsquo;s contagious!</p>

<p>Terminals</p>

<ul>
<li>Better seating</li>
<li>More A/C outlets</li>
<li>Free wifi</li>
<li>Smoking rooms</li>
</ul>


<p>Flights</p>

<ul>
<li>Allow people to use electronic devices the whole time</li>
<li>Turn on the entertainment system and A/C before passengers board and leave them on until people are off the plane</li>
<li>USB charging stations on each seat</li>
<li>Assigned overhead bins</li>
<li>Some sane amount of free alcohol (maybe 1 drink per 4 hours)</li>
<li>A light snack (research points to about 300 calories per 3 hours)</li>
<li>Treat people like adults!</li>
</ul>


<p>There are some other ideas in <a title="Salon" href="http://www.salon.com/technology/ask_the_pilot/2010/09/15/airplane_seating/index.html" target="_blank">this article on Salon</a>.</p>

<p>Beyond these, improved communication and more travel options would be fantastic. What would you like to see?</p>

      <p>This morning I received an email titled</p>

<blockquote>
<h1>Lane added you to the group &#8220;Close Friends and Family.&#8221;</h1>
</blockquote>


<p>Followed shortly thereafter by this one:</p>

<blockquote>
<h1>Lane Holloway changed the name of the group &#8220;Close Friends and Family&#8221; to &#8220;Friends and Family&#8221;.</h1>
</blockquote>


<p>Opening the emails reveals a link to Facebook. When I asked my brother, he said he had no idea it would email people. Good thing he did not make a group for people he does not like&hellip;</p>

<p><a title="Facebook Blog: Groups" href="http://www.facebook.com/blog.php?post=434700832130" target="_blank">The idea behind</a> <a title="Facebook Groups" href="http://www.facebook.com/groups/" target="_blank">Facebook Groups</a> is good: organize your connections and filter the appropriate information to them; however, I do not like that others would know what group they are in&ndash;informing people is a user&rsquo;s choice. By informing people that they won&rsquo;t receive all your updates, you defeat the purpose of selective correspondence. For example, &ldquo;Oh, Seth put me in group &lsquo;no updates for you&rsquo;&hellip; I thought he just didn&rsquo;t use facebook <em>cry</em>&rdquo; That&rsquo;s, of course, a made up example. I love everyone :)</p>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/on-the-usability-of-my-old-samsung-cell-phone/">On the usability of my old Samsung cell phone</a></h1>
      <p>For years, I lived without a smart phone. (Looking back, I&rsquo;m not sure I was truly living, but it was something resembling life.) My little Samsung phone had great battery life, clear call quality, and it fit nicely in my pocket. The phone never failed me when calling or texting (although I don&rsquo;t care for T9). Overall, great usability! For all its good, however, the alarm was really funky! I&rsquo;m not sure how the interactions developed. Let me illustrate with a few examples:</p>

<ul>
<li>Once, while traveling overseas the alarm went off despite the phone being powered off. After that, I made sure alarms were inactive before I turned off the phone.</li>
<li>If the alarm went off and you pressed the volume up button on the side of the phone, the alarm was snoozed; however, if you pressed the volume down button, the alarm was canceled. Neat that you could control the alarm without opening the phone! But the buttons are small to begin with and they&rsquo;re adjacent to one another so it is very hard to hit the proper one.  I used the alarm for  appointments as well as my primary wake-up call. Many mornings I fumbled in the dark to grab my phone; in the process I would hit the mute button. If I was really tired, this meant I slept undisturbed for an extra couple hours. Whoops.</li>
<li>You could not snooze or accept the alarm by opening the phone while it was going off. Near as I could figure, opening the phone while the alarm rang was equivalent to snoozing. Instead, you had to go into the alarm menu, toggle the alarm on then off. This reveals another odd feature:</li>
<li>There were only two states: on and off. Snoozing the alarm would show the alarm as off, yet it would continue to buzz periodically. Confusing!</li>
</ul>


<p>So how would I fix it? A couple simple things: the alarm should properly convey the three possible states: on, snooze, off. A bell icon in addition to off could take the place of a more explicit &ldquo;SNOOZE&rdquo; state, but the information should be present. Next, make both external buttons snooze. Now, a user can quiet the alarm or give themself an extra few minutes sleep. Once you open the phone, you can tell what state the alarm is in and take the proper action. Et viola!</p>

      <p>Like all generations, <a title="Wikipedia: Generation Y" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_Y" target="_blank">my generation</a> is unique. Broadly, we are digital natives who don&rsquo;t want to waste our lives. Our generally delayed launch goes hand-in-hand with the fact that <a title="NY Times: What is it about 20-somethings?" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/22/magazine/22Adulthood-t.html" target="_blank">20-somethings are experiencing quarter-life crises</a> like none other. While previous generations were interested in independence and making it themselves, I think the current generation wants to move forward in the best way possible and they&rsquo;re willing to wait for inspiration to strike.</p>

<p>To help people make informed decisions, I believe we can apply artificial intelligence to social media and report the results. An analysis of (semi-) public information including shared/retweeted links, blog posts/comments, and anything we &ldquo;like&rdquo; would certainly lead to conclusions about the person. If you analyze a person in this way, you could determine interests and broad competencies. This report alone would be powerful, but we could extend the system to match careers, people, places, etc. that match the interests. Now, the aimless 20-something has a jumping-off point that is completely personalized.</p>

<p>As far as I know, this does not yet exist. The closest thing I can find is <a title="my6sense" href="http://www.my6sense.com/website/a/MainPage" target="_blank">my6sense</a>, which mines your social streams and helps you find the best content. Does anyone know of an instantiation of what I&rsquo;m talking about? Would you be willing to use such a system? How would you improve it? Let me know!</p>

The Pitchfork 500 is actually a 500 song review from the music geniuses at <a title="Pitchfork" href="http://www.pitchfork.com" target="_blank">Pitchfork.com</a>; Grooveshark allows users to create and share playlists, so people have taken the review and created the accompanying playlist.</p>

<p>For the past week I&rsquo;ve been listening to the 500 song playlist that covers virtually every musical style from 1978 to now. I&rsquo;m deleting roughly &frac12; the songs, but I&rsquo;m discovering a lot of great new stuff, old favorites, and deeper tracks from bands that I knew little about. If you&rsquo;re looking to find some new music or you want to enjoy a wide variety of old favorites, give it a listen.</p>

      <p>Phishing is presumably big business (although <a title="Dancho Danchev's analysis of profit in the digital black market" href="http://www.zdnet.com/blog/security/microsoft-study-debunks-profitability-of-the-underground-economy/3522" target="_blank">maybe not</a>). Because email is very cheap to send, phishing has a low barrier for entry. Usually, Gmail&rsquo;s spam filter is so accurate that I don&rsquo;t see the phishing emails, however, recently some Blizzard themed messages have gotten through. I get the impression that the emails are crafted by foreigners who lack the finesse necessary to deceive people&ndash;a good thing, no doubt. As with most pursuits, the devil is in the details. Let me illustrate with the most recent email to pierce Gmail&rsquo;s phishing armor:</p>

<p>I like the use of ® and ™! Those are definitely nice touches. However, Blizzard begins by greeting you with the name on the account. Moving on, the CD key should have dashes. Whoops. Next, we see &ldquo;Battle.n Account - Or Create at Battle.net Account.&rdquo; Within a few words, they misspell Battle.net and give you the proper spelling. Then there&rsquo;s the gratuitous use of capitalization throughout. Seen here on &ldquo;Account,&rdquo; &ldquo;Or,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Create.&rdquo; Throughout, there are a few small, unprofessional and inconsistent bits, like the lack of carriage return between items 3 and 4. Then &ldquo;CDKey&rdquo; is lacking a space&hellip; Another awesome failure: the &ldquo;Vis<strong><em>t</em></strong>a&rdquo; credit card type! A couple lines lower, the &ldquo;Shipping Tax&rdquo; itemized seems off.</p>

<p>To be fair, if you were expecting a StarCraft email (sadly, the phishers are two weeks late) and gave only  a quick glance, the email could work. It is apparently sent by Blizzard Entertainment! However, digging deeper in the email header we see more incorrect details:</p>

<blockquote>from    Blizzard Entertainment
to  seth@sethholloway.com
date    Wed, Aug 11, 2010 at 8:46 PM
subject Battle.net Account Management
mailed-by   hotmail.com</blockquote>


<p>Mailed by hotmail? Phishy. Details, details!</p>

<p>Also, it&rsquo;s important to hover over links before following them&hellip; This is probably my favorite part: &ldquo;wowsuppor-check-blizzard.com.&rdquo; I guess wowsuppor<strong><em>t</em></strong>-check-blizzard.com was already registered :) And, of course, official Blizzard emails direct you to us.battle.net instead of blizzard.com. Details!</p>

<p>Another detail that reeks of fraud is the use of &ldquo;WoW&rdquo;/&ldquo;wow&rdquo;, which refers to another Blizzard product, World of Warcraft. Account management, StarCraft II, and World of Warcraft blend into one weak attempt at phishing.</p>

<p>I believe that every critique should come with a suggestion, so here&rsquo;s my suggestion: buy a legitimate copy of StarCraft II and copy the official email exactly, changing only the link (from official site to your faked site). Then, replicate their website and direct people to the fake. To Blizzard&rsquo;s credit they do not make copying the page easy because they cleverly use dynamically rendered Ajax elements with obfuscated JavaScript and XSLT. They also have a lot of content and they update the pages regularly. Another idea: direct them to your domain, infect their computer with malware, and quickly forward them to battle.net so they&rsquo;re none the wiser.</p>

<p>If you want to step up to the big leagues, you&rsquo;ll have to concentrate on the details!</p>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/rails-3-document-on-error/">Rails 3 document.on error</a></h1>
      <p>I&rsquo;m working through <a title="Agile Web Development with Rails" href="http://pragprog.com/titles/rails4/agile-web-development-with-rails" target="_blank">Agile Web Development with Rails, 4th Edition</a>. Overall, the book is well written&ndash;readable, nice depth and breadth, great example (ecommerce site)&ndash;and I would recommend it highly; however,  Chapter 11, adding Ajax support to the cart, has given me hell.</p>

<p>I spent hours working through the example a couple times, diffing my source against the <a title="Agile Web Development with Rails source code" href="http://pragprog.com/titles/rails4/source_code" target="_blank">source code provided</a>, starting and restarting the server, trying multiple browsers (Safari, Firefox, Chrome), grepping for errors,  and googling. Finally, I arrived at the solution:</p>

<p>To remedy this problem, I updated my public/javascripts/prototype.js file from the <a href="http://www.prototypejs.org/download" target="_blank">prototype download page</a>. At the time of writing, that was <a href="http://prototypejs.org/assets/2010/5/13/prototype.js" target="_blank"><a href="http://prototypejs.org/assets/2010/5/13/prototype.js">http://prototypejs.org/assets/2010/5/13/prototype.js</a></a></p>

<p><strong>Debugging</strong></p>

<p>Here are the steps I followed to track down the problem.</p>

<p>First, I noticed that the page was refreshing everytime I pressed an &ldquo;Add to Cart&rdquo; button. I made sure the necessary files were in place and the javascript input was defined for the create method I was Ajaxifying. To ensure the button was properly defined, I viewed source and ensured the element had an attribute <em>data-remote=&ldquo;true&rdquo;.</em> Despite proper HTML and Ruby, the development.log showed that I was still retrieving the page as HTML instead of JavaScript</p>

<blockquote>Started POST &#8220;/line_items?product_id=3&#8221; for 127.0.0.1 at Sun Jul 18 21:06:41 -0500 2010
Processing by LineItemsController#create as HTML
Parameters: {&#8220;product_id&#8221;=&gt;&#8221;3&#8221;, &#8220;authenticity_token&#8221;=&gt;&#8221;Dsv044fqfo7H46jLYx3e6qnbCgqk3Tcoij6pqbOQZx4=&#8221;}</blockquote>


<p>So I checked the browser errors. Firefox showed</p>

<blockquote>Error: document.on is not a function
Source File: http://localhost:3000/javascripts/rails.js?1277734011
Line: 136</blockquote>


<p>Inspecting the element in Chrome I saw</p>

<blockquote>Uncaught TypeError: Object #&lt;an HTMLDocument&gt; has no method &#8216;on&#8217;</blockquote>


<p>Looking at the rails.js file, line 136, we see</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>  document.on("click", "*[data-confirm]", function(event, element) {
    var message = element.readAttribute('data-confirm');
    if (!confirm(message)) event.stop();
  });</pre>
</blockquote>


<p>Between the errors and the rails.js file, we see that none of the included JavaScript files nor the browser defined the method. A new <a title="Rails 3 Patch" href="https://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8994/tickets/5109-make-prototypejs-compatible-with-railsjs-for-30" target="_blank">Rails 3 patch</a> will upgrade prototype from 1.6.1 to 1.7rc2, so future generations will not experience this fun.</p>

      <p>I&rsquo;ve been enjoying the World Cup for the past three weeks&ndash;while still getting all of my work done, of course. One thing that has been really neat is seeing the diverse cultures communicating. I imagine the players and referees could play without words (we&rsquo;ll let them keep whistles and hand-signs), but very frequently players verbally plead for calls and the ref explicitly announces situations to players. The on-field interactions seem to be in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language">English</a>.</p>

<p>When Paraguay, coached by an Argentinian, <a href="http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/matches/round=249718/match=300061506/index.html">played</a> Spain, coached by a Spaniard, they were officiated by a Guatemalan, Costa Rican, Honduran, and Mexican; I&rsquo;d guess everyone spoke Spanish. But the situation gets more complicated if we look at when Paraguay (native Spanish speakers) <a href="http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/matches/round=249717/match=300061497/index.html">played</a> Japan (native Japanese speakers) with refs from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium">Belgium</a> (official languages are Dutch, French, and German). My lip-reading skills are admittedly amateur, but I perceived English. This has been the case throughout the tournament. Now, I&rsquo;m glad that I focused on furthering my English skills instead of futilely learning a foreign language because everyone speaks English. The World Cup taught me so :-)</p>

<p>So, when and how are players from all of the world learning English well enough to communicate with other similarly diverse English-speakers? When did this start? Because <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diego_Maradona">Maradona</a>, an old school footballer, interviews in Spanish using a translator.</p>

With the standard text-based resume I found it hard to show my simultaneous jobs (for example, in Spring 2010 I was pursuing my PhD, working part-time at IBM, researching under Christine, teaching/grading Project Management, keeping up the lab&rsquo;s computing infrastructure, supervising Michael Hanna, assisting a couple companies with their computing needs, and actively participating in two organizations).

<p>It was a great project with HTML/CSS and JavaScript! I was inspired  by other great infographics, but after I had published the resume, I  found there were some other timeline resumes I could have used as a  guide. In any case, I like mine and I hope you do too!</p>

<p>Do you see any improvements I could make? Anything that is unclear or  hard to use?</p>

      <p>I&rsquo;ve long been in the habit of spelling my last name for people after I tell them. Some people reply almost indignantly, &ldquo;How else would you spell it?!&rdquo; Well, I set up my <a title="Google Webmaster Tools" href="https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/home?hl=en" target="_blank">Google Webmaster tools</a> and people are stumbling upon the site from the query &ldquo;<a title="Seth Holloway Dot Com" href="http://www.sethholloway.com/" target="_blank">seth halloway</a>.&rdquo; Perhaps it&rsquo;s time to publish all the common misspellings of my name:</p>

<ul>
<li><a title="Seth Holloway Dot Com" href="http://www.sethholloway.com/" target="_blank">seth holloway</a></li>
<li><a title="Seth Holloway Dot Com" href="http://www.sethholloway.com/" target="_blank">seth halloway</a></li>
<li><a title="Seth Holloway Dot Com" href="http://www.sethholloway.com/" target="_blank">seth hallaway</a></li>
<li><a title="Seth Holloway Dot Com" href="http://www.sethholloway.com/" target="_blank">seth hollaway</a></li>
</ul>


<p>At my first grade graduation, the principal beckoned me across the stage by calling &ldquo;<a title="Seth Holloway Dot Com" href="http://www.sethholloway.com/" target="_blank">seeth holloway</a>&rdquo; and I&rsquo;ve been called &ldquo;<a title="Seth Holloway Dot Com" href="http://www.sethholloway.com/" target="_blank">sean holloway</a>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<a title="Seth Holloway Dot Com" href="http://www.sethholloway.com/" target="_blank">scott holloway</a>!&rdquo; After attending a diverse graduate program, I have heard some amazing mispronounciations and I know that I have nothing to complain about :)</p>
