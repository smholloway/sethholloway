      <p>I&rsquo;ve been enjoying the World Cup for the past three weeks&mdash;while still getting all of my work done, of course. One thing that has been really neat is seeing the diverse cultures communicating. I imagine the players and referees could play without words (we&rsquo;ll let them keep whistles and hand-signs), but very frequently players verbally plead for calls and the ref explicitly announces situations to players. The on-field interactions seem to be in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language">English</a>.</p>

<p>When Paraguay, coached by an Argentinian, <a href="http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/matches/round=249718/match=300061506/index.html">played</a> Spain, coached by a Spaniard, they were officiated by a Guatemalan, Costa Rican, Honduran, and Mexican; I&rsquo;d guess everyone spoke Spanish. But the situation gets more complicated if we look at when Paraguay (native Spanish speakers) <a href="http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/matches/round=249717/match=300061497/index.html">played</a> Japan (native Japanese speakers) with refs from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium">Belgium</a> (official languages are Dutch, French, and German). My lip-reading skills are admittedly amateur, but I perceived English. This has been the case throughout the tournament. Now, I&rsquo;m glad that I focused on furthering my English skills instead of futilely learning a foreign language because everyone speaks English. The World Cup taught me so :&ndash;)</p>

<p>So, when and how are players from all of the world learning English well enough to communicate with other similarly diverse English-speakers? When did this start? Because <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diego_Maradona">Maradona</a>, an old school footballer, interviews in Spanish using a translator.</p>

      <p>A friend of mine sent me a video of Dustin Carter, a wrestling badass. Check out his workout:</p>

<p>Despite having no arms and no legs  (a rare infection forced him to have both arms and legs amputated), Dustin has an awesome record. It&rsquo;s really inspirational; as one of the <a href="http://www.flowrestling.org">Flowrestling</a> comments says, &ldquo;No excuses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s also a documentary on him. Here&rsquo;s a teaser:</p>

<object width="480" height="385"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/qmicID3JwsE&hl=en_US&fs=1&"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/qmicID3JwsE&hl=en_US&fs=1&" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="480" height="385"></embed></object>


<p>Even Sports Illustrated has picked up on him <a href="http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/multimedia/photo_gallery/0804/wrestling.dustin.carter/content.1.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>I must admit, I find the lives of differently abled people quite interesting, and Dustin is no exception. It&rsquo;s amazing that he has adapted and succeeded. Well done, Dustin Carter! Keep wrestling!</p>

      <p>Yesterday my grandmother, Viola Holloway, passed away after 89 fruitful years. While this is incredibly painful for me, her passing is not all sad; given her condition this semester, I can say she&rsquo;s in a  better place now.</p>

<p>Viola was an awesome grandma, and I&rsquo;m going to miss her tremendously. She always had treats and encouraging words for me! I will cherish the memories and try to be as loving and supportive of my progeny as she was of hers.</p>

<p>Exercise. Be happy. Live simply. Viola had it right.</p>

      <p>After birthing a super cute baby boy, a good friend, Tahra, started a business selling handcrafted baby items (with another friend in a similar situation, Katie). The business, <a title="Petite Pensieri" href="http://www.etsy.com/shop/PetitePensieri" target="_blank">Petite Pensieri</a>, is very inspiring; I have been impressed by so many elements! Tahra and Katie have shown tremendous initiative and their products are high-quality and useful.</p>

<p>From a technological standpoint, <a title="Etsy" href="http://www.etsy.com/" target="_blank">Etsy</a> offers an amazing platform for handmade items. The service allows you to quickly and easily list items for sale. <a title="Etsy Fees" href="http://www.etsy.com/fees.php" target="_blank">Etsy&rsquo;s fees</a> are quite reasonble: &ldquo;It costs 20 cents to list an item for four months. When your item sells,  you’ll pay a 3.5% transaction fee.&rdquo; <a title="Shopify" href="http://www.shopify.com/" target="_blank">Shopify</a> is a similar idea: you create an online storefront and they manage everything else for a fee. The monthly <a title="Shopify: Fees" href="https://app.shopify.com/services/signup" target="_blank">cost of Shopify</a> ranges from $24 (for 100 products and a 2% transaction fee) to $699 per month (for 50,000 products and no transaction fee), so the two sites addresses slightly different needs. With some quick math I&rsquo;d say Etsy is cheaper up to $1,600 worth of sales a month (24+0.02<em>x = 0.035</em>x &ndash;&gt; 24 = 0.015*x &ndash;&gt; 1600 = x). To be fair, Shopify wins if, for example, you want custom domain names and landing pages or selling goods that don&rsquo;t qualify for Etsy.</p>

<p>Tonight, Tahra and Katie will be offering their awesome wares at <a title="About.com: First Thursday in Austin" href="http://austin.about.com/od/eventsandactivities/a/first_thursday_austin.htm" target="_blank">First Thursday</a>. If you&rsquo;re around, go enjoy the experience and keep Austin weird (or at least local ;&ndash;))! If you&rsquo;re going to a baby shower, buy something nice from <a title="Petite Pensieri" href="http://www.etsy.com/shop/PetitePensieri" target="_blank">Petite Pensieri</a> and the baby will thank you later!</p>

      <p>Over the weekend I published <a title="Seth Holloway Timeline Resume" href="http://www.sethholloway.com/timelineResume.html" target="_blank">my resume as a timeline</a>. With the standard text-based resume I found it hard to show my simultaneous jobs (for example, in Spring 2010 I was pursuing my PhD, working part-time at IBM, researching under Christine, teaching/grading Project Management, keeping up the lab&rsquo;s computing infrastructure, supervising Michael Hanna, assisting a couple companies with their computing needs, and actively participating in two organizations). The timeline allows me to show these jobs at once rather than tacitly asking the reader to juggle all the &ldquo;X &ndash; Present&rdquo; entries under multiple headings.</p>

<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-1011" title="TimelineResume" src="/images/TimelineResume-300x120.png" alt="Seth Holloway's timeline resume" width="300" height="120" /></p>

<p>It was a great project with HTML/CSS and JavaScript! I was inspired  by other great infographics, but after I had published the resume, I  found there were some other timeline resumes I could have used as a  guide. In any case, I like mine and I hope you do too!</p>

<p>Do you see any improvements I could make? Anything that is unclear or  hard to use?</p>

      <p>I&rsquo;ve long been in the habit of spelling my last name for people after I tell them. Some people reply almost indignantly, &ldquo;How else would you spell it?!&rdquo; Well, I set up my <a title="Google Webmaster Tools" href="https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/home?hl=en" target="_blank">Google Webmaster tools</a> and people are stumbling upon the site from the query &ldquo;<a title="Seth Holloway Dot Com" href="http://www.sethholloway.com/" target="_blank">seth halloway</a>.&rdquo; Perhaps it&rsquo;s time to publish all the common misspellings of my name:</p>

<ul>
<li><a title="Seth Holloway Dot Com" href="http://www.sethholloway.com/" target="_blank">seth holloway</a></li>
<li><a title="Seth Holloway Dot Com" href="http://www.sethholloway.com/" target="_blank">seth halloway</a></li>

<li><a title="Seth Holloway Dot Com" href="http://www.sethholloway.com/" target="_blank">seth hollaway</a></li>
</ul>


<p>At my first grade graduation, the principal beckoned me across the stage by calling &ldquo;<a title="Seth Holloway Dot Com" href="http://www.sethholloway.com/" target="_blank">seeth holloway</a>&rdquo; and I&rsquo;ve been called &ldquo;<a title="Seth Holloway Dot Com" href="http://www.sethholloway.com/" target="_blank">sean holloway</a>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<a title="Seth Holloway Dot Com" href="http://www.sethholloway.com/" target="_blank">scott holloway</a>!&rdquo; After attending a diverse graduate program, I have heard some amazing mispronounciations and I know that I have nothing to complain about :)</p>

      <p>One day I was enjoying a balmy afternoon at <a title="Mozart's Coffee Roasters" href="http://www.mozartscoffee.com/" target="_blank">Mozart&rsquo;s</a> with my wife. While it was not my goal to eavesdrop, I overheard two women talking about finding jobs&mdash;a common topic these days. The profound bit that I picked up on was an analogy: finding jobs is like spinning plates. If you apply too much or too little force to a plate, the plate will fall. I think this simple idea applies to all facets of life; once again, moderation is a virtue.</p>

      <p><a title="Wikipedia: Flash" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash" target="_blank">Flash</a>, the popular multimedia platform that helps make websites more interactive, has cookies separate from your web browser&rsquo;s cookies. They&rsquo;re called <a title="Wikipedia: Local Shared Object" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Shared_Object" target="_blank">local shared objects (LSO)</a> and they may be a security hole&mdash;like all things Flash ;&ndash;)</p>

<p>There are a number of directories where the flash cookies may be stored. For example, on Mac OS X, LSOs are stored in two locations:</p>

<ul>
<li>~/Library/Preferences/Macromedia/Flash\ Player/#SharedObjects/</li>
<li>~/Library/Preferences/Macromedia/Flash\ Player/macromedia.com/support/flashplayer/sys/</li>
</ul>


<p>And there are more possible! For a detailed list, check the <a title="Wikipedia: LSO#File Locations" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Shared_Object#File_locations" target="_blank">list of locations on Wikipedia&rsquo;s LSO entry</a>.</p>

<p>You can manually navigate to these locations and delete nasty ad-tracking/malware-hosting objects; however, while deleting unwanted cookies is worthwhile, it&rsquo;s not a good long-term solution. I recommend you <a title="Flash Controls" href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager02.html" target="_blank">update your Flash settings</a> (this interface also allows you to delete your LSOs) now! There are several tabs to look through, but don&rsquo;t worry&mdash;it&rsquo;s quick. Make sure you deny access to your camera and microphone! For finer grained control, the Firefox extension <a title="Objection Firefox Addon" href="http://objection.mozdev.org/" target="_blank">Objection</a> helps track and <a title="GHacks: Delete Flash Cookies" href="http://www.ghacks.net/2008/07/30/delete-flash-cookies/" target="_blank">eliminate Flash cookies</a>.</p>

<p>Whatever your strategy, I wish you luck!</p>

      <p>My labmate suggested I read &ldquo;<a title="You and Your Research by Hamming" href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.pdf" target="_blank">You and Your Research</a>,&rdquo; a transcript from a speech given by <a title="Wikipedia: Richard Hamming" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Hamming" target="_blank">Richard &ldquo;Dick&rdquo; Hamming</a>. Hamming is famous for, amongst other things, <a title="Wikipedia: Hamming codes" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_code" target="_blank">Hamming Codes</a>. The speech is meant for scientists, but I think the quotes generalize well to a large segment of the population. Below are the sections I found particularly interesting.</p>

<blockquote>I have to get you to drop your modesty and say to yourself, &#8220;Yes, I would like to do first-class work.&#8221; Our society frowns on people who set out to do really good work.

One of the characteristics of successful scientists is having courage.Most mathematicians, theoretical physicists, and astrophysicists do what we consider their best work when they are young. It is not that they don&#8217;t do good work in their old age but what we value most is often what they did early.

But let me say why age seems to have the effect it does. In the first place if you do some good work you will find yourself on all kinds of committees and unable to do any more work. You may find yourself as I saw Brattain when he got a Nobel Prize&#8230; Now he could only work on great problems.

When you are famous it is hard to work on small problems&#8230; The great scientists often make this error. They fail to continue to plant the little acorns from which the might oak trees grow.

What appears to be a fault, often, by a change of viewpoint, turns out to be one of the greatest assets you can have.

So ideal working conditions are very strange. The ones you want aren&#8217;t always the best ones for you.

&#8220;Knowledge and productivity are like compound interest.&#8221; Given two people of approximately the same ability and one person who works ten percent more than the other, the latter will more than twice outperform the former.

I spent a good deal more of my time for some years trying to work a bit harder and I found, in fact, I could get more work done. I don&#8217;t like to say it in front of my wife, but I did sort of neglect her sometimes; I needed to study. You have to neglect things if you intend to get what you want done. There&#8217;s no question about this.

Great scientists tolerate ambiguity very well.

If you believe too much you&#8217;ll never notice flaws; if you doubt too much you won&#8217;t get started.

&#8220;What important problems are you working on?&#8221; And after some more time I came in one day and said, &#8220;If what you are doing is not important, and if you don&#8217;t think it is going to lead to something important, why are you&#8230; working on it?&#8221;

Let me warn you, &#8216;important problem&#8217; must be phrased carefully. The three outstanding problems in physics, in a certain sense, were never wrked on while I was at Bell Labs. By important I mean guaranteed a Nobel Prize and any sum of money you want to mention. We didn&#8217;t work on (1) time travel, (2) teleportation, and (3) antigravity. They are not important problems because we do not have an attack.

You can&#8217;t alawys know exactly where to be, but you can keep active in places where something might happen.

I notice that if you have a door to your office closed, you get more work done today and tomorrow, and you are more productive than most. But 10 years later somehow you don&#8217;t know quite what problems are worth working on, all the hard work you do is sort of tangential in importance&#8230;. I can say there is a pretty good correlation between those who work witht he doors open and those who ultimately do important work.

You should do your job in such a fashion that others can build on top of it.

It&#8217;s just as easy to do a broad, general job as one very special case. And it&#8217;s much more satisfying and rewarding!

There are three things you have to do in selling. You have to learn to write clearly and well so that people will read it, you must learn to give reasonably formal talks, and you also must learn to give informal talks.

Most of the time the audience wants a broad general talk and wants much more survey and background than the speaker is willing to give. As a result, many talks are ineffective.

The tendency is to give a highly restricted, safe talk; this is usually ineffective.

I changed something I did and I marched in the direction I thought was important. It&#8217;s that easy.

You can educate your bosses.

To struggle to make something of yourself seems to be worthwhile in itself. The success and fame are sort of dividends, in my opinion.

He had his personality defects of wanting total control and was not willing to recognize that you need the support of the system.

Another personality defect is ego assertion&#8230;

You should dress according to the expectations of the audience spoken to.

[Fighting the system is] wasted effort! I didn&#8217;t say you should comform: I said, &#8220;The appearance of conforming gets you a long way.&#8221; If you chose to assert your ego in any number of ways, &#8220;I am going to do it my way,&#8221; you pay a small steady prioce throughout the whole of your professional career. And this, over a whole lifetime, adds up to an enormous amount of needless trouble.

By taking the trouble to tell jokes to the secretaries and being a little friendly, I got superb secretarial help.

By realizing you have to use the system and studying how to get the system to do your work, you learn how to adapt the system to your desires. Or you can fight it steadily, as a small undeclared war, for the whole of your life.

I am saying that my study of able people is that they don&#8217;t get themselves committed to that kind of warfare. They play a little bit and drop it and get on with their work.

Many second-rate fellow get caught up in some little twitting of the system, and carries it through to warfare. He expends his energy in a foolish project. Now you are going to tell me that someone has to change the system. I agree; somebody has to. Which do you want to be? The person who changes the system or the person who does first-class science? Which person is it that you want to be? Be clear, when you fight the system and struggle with it, what you are doing, how far to go out of amusement, and how much to waste your effort fighting the system.

I have observed almost all scientists enjoy a certain amount of twitting the system for the sheer love of it.

Originality is being different. You can&#8217;t be an original scientist without having some other original characteristics. But many a scientist has let his quirks in other places make him pay a far hgiher price than is necessary for the ego satisfaction he or she gets.

Another fault is anger.

Another thing you should look for is the positive side of things instead of the negative.

You can tell other people all the alibis you want. I don&#8217;t mind. But to yourself, try to be honest.

In summary, I claim that some of the reasons why so many people who have greatness within their grasp don&#8217;t succeed are: they don&#8217;t work on important problems, they don&#8217;t become emotionally involved, they don&#8217;t try and change what is difficult to some other situation which is easily done but is still important, and they keep giving themselves alibis why they don&#8217;t.

&#8230;if you want to be a great scientist you&#8217;re going to have to put up with stress. You can lead a nice life; you can be a nice guy or you can be a great scientist.

There was a fellow at Bell labs, a very, very, smart guy. He was always in the library; he read everything&#8230; but there&#8217;s no effect named after him because he read too much&#8230; You read, but it&#8217;s not the amount, it is the way you read that counts.

IF you want to get recognition long-haul, it seems to me writing books is more contribution because most of us need orientation&#8230; we have come close to doubling knowledge every 17 years, more or less. And we cope with that, essentially, by specialization. In the next 340 years at that rate, there will be 20 doublings, i.e. a million, and there will be a million fields of specialty for every one field right now. It isn&#8217;t going to happen. The present growth of knowledge will choke itself off until we get different tools. I believe that books which try to digest, coordinate, get rid of the duplication, get rid of the less fruitful methods and present the underlying ideas clearly of what we know now, will be the things the future generations will value.

&#8230;every seven years make a significant, if not complete, shift in your field.

You have to change. You get tired after a while; you use up your originality in one field.

When your vision of what you want to do is what you can do single-handedly, then you should pursue it. The day your vision, what you think needs to be done, is bigger than what you can do single-handedly, then you have to move toward management.</blockquote>
