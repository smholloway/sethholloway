      <p>This morning my cat jumped on the bed, walked up to me, plopped down on my head, and started purring. This morning ritual can be annoying, but I appreciate how open with his feelings the cat is. When he likes something, he purrs; when he doesn&rsquo;t, he runs off. With the holiday season upon us, I think this is a great way to live: show whenever you like something, and if you&rsquo;re unhappy then walk away.</p>

<p>Happy holidays everyone! Be like a cat and enjoy life your way :)</p>

      <p>Everyday, millions of people fly. I&rsquo;d guess most everyone hates the process. As with most things in life, happy people make everything better (they&rsquo;re more productive, etc)&mdash;and it&rsquo;s contagious!</p>

<p>Terminals</p>

<ul>
<li>Better seating</li>
<li>More A/C outlets</li>
<li>Free wifi</li>
<li>Smoking rooms</li>
</ul>


<p>Flights</p>

<ul>
<li>Allow people to use electronic devices the whole time</li>
<li>Turn on the entertainment system and A/C before passengers board and leave them on until people are off the plane</li>
<li>USB charging stations on each seat</li>
<li>Assigned overhead bins</li>
<li>Some sane amount of free alcohol (maybe 1 drink per 4 hours)</li>
<li>A light snack (research points to about 300 calories per 3 hours)</li>
<li>Treat people like adults!</li>
</ul>


<p>There are some other ideas in <a title="Salon" href="http://www.salon.com/technology/ask_the_pilot/2010/09/15/airplane_seating/index.html" target="_blank">this article on Salon</a>.</p>

<p>Beyond these, improved communication and more travel options would be fantastic.Â What would you like to see?</p>

      <p>This morning I received an email titled</p>

<blockquote>
<h1>Lane added you to the group &#8220;Close Friends and Family.&#8221;</h1>
</blockquote>


<p>Followed shortly thereafter by this one:</p>

<blockquote>
<h1>Lane Holloway changed the name of the group &#8220;Close Friends and Family&#8221; to &#8220;Friends and Family&#8221;.</h1>
</blockquote>


<p>Opening the emails reveals a link to Facebook. When I asked my brother, he said he had no idea it would email people. Good thing he did not make a group for people he does not like&hellip;</p>

<p><a title="Facebook Blog: Groups" href="http://www.facebook.com/blog.php?post=434700832130" target="_blank">The idea behind</a> <a title="Facebook Groups" href="http://www.facebook.com/groups/" target="_blank">Facebook Groups</a> is good: organize your connections and filter the appropriate information to them; however, I do not like that others would know what group they are in&mdash;informing people is a user&rsquo;s choice. By informing people that they won&rsquo;t receive all your updates, you defeat the purpose of selective correspondence. For example, &ldquo;Oh, Seth put me in group &lsquo;no updates for you&rsquo;&hellip; I thought he just didn&rsquo;t use facebook <em>cry</em>&rdquo; That&rsquo;s, of course, a made up example. I love everyone :)</p>

      <p>I&rsquo;m extremely proud of my wife, Andrea, as she started <a title="McGregor Holloway" href="http://www.mcgregorholloway.com/" target="_blank">McGregor Holloway</a> with her friend, Dr. Alison McGregor. Both have taught English overseas and helped local students and professionals with their communication skills, so it&rsquo;s a great pairing.</p>

<p>What are language services? Andrea&rsquo;s favorite term is &ldquo;accent modification&rdquo; but other people call it various things such as</p>

<ul>
<li>changing your accent</li>
<li><a title="Wikipedia: Accent Reduction" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accent_reduction" target="_blank">accent reduction</a></li>
<li>elocution</li>
<li>speech instruction</li>
<li>voice improvement</li>
<li>learning English</li>
<li>English pronounciation</li>
<li>cultural studies</li>
<li>acting more American</li>
<li>speaking or talking like an American</li>
</ul>


<p>Andrea and Alison have some really neat ideas for how to help people! For now, they can support people (students and technology professionals, so far) in the Austin area. I&rsquo;m a firm believer in the power of communication skills, so I encourage anyone who has problems being understood to contact them.</p>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/on-the-usability-of-my-old-samsung-cell-phone/">On the usability of my old Samsung cell phone</a></h1>
      <p>For years, I lived without a smart phone. (Looking back, I&rsquo;m not sure I was truly living, but it was something resembling life.) My little Samsung phone had great battery life, clear call quality, and it fit nicely in my pocket. The phone never failed me when calling or texting (although I don&rsquo;t care for T9). Overall, great usability! For all its good, however, the alarm was really funky! I&rsquo;m not sure how the interactions developed. Let me illustrate with a few examples:</p>

<ul>
<li>Once, while traveling overseas the alarm went off despite the phone being powered off. After that, I made sure alarms were inactive before I turned off the phone.</li>
<li>If the alarm went off and you pressed the volume up button on the side of the phone, the alarm was snoozed; however, if you pressed the volume down button, the alarm was canceled. Neat that you could control the alarm without opening the phone! But the buttons are small to begin with and they&rsquo;re adjacent to one another so it is very hard to hit the proper one. Â I used the alarm for Â appointments as well as my primary wake-up call. Many mornings I fumbled in the dark to grab my phone; in the process I would hit the mute button. If I was really tired, this meant I slept undisturbed for an extra couple hours. Whoops.</li>
<li>You could not snooze or accept the alarm by opening the phone while it was going off. Near as I could figure, opening the phone while the alarm rang was equivalent to snoozing. Instead, you had to go into the alarm menu, toggle the alarm on then off. This reveals another odd feature:</li>
<li>There were only two states: on and off. Snoozing the alarm would show the alarm as off, yet it would continue to buzz periodically. Confusing!</li>
</ul>


<p>So how would I fix it? A couple simple things: the alarm should properly convey the three possible states: on, snooze, off. A bell icon in addition to off could take the place of a more explicit &ldquo;SNOOZE&rdquo; state, but the information should be present. Next, make both external buttons snooze. Now, a user can quiet the alarm or give themself an extra few minutes sleep. Once you open the phone, you can tell what state the alarm is in and take the proper action. Et viola!</p>

      <p>Like all generations, <a title="Wikipedia: Generation Y" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_Y" target="_blank">my generation</a> is unique. Broadly, we are digital natives who don&rsquo;t want to waste our lives. Our generally delayed launch goes hand-in-hand with the fact thatÂ <a title="NY Times: What is it about 20-somethings?" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/22/magazine/22Adulthood-t.html" target="_blank">20-somethings are experiencing quarter-life crises</a> like none other. While previous generations were interested in independence and making it themselves, I think the current generation wants to move forward in the best way possible and they&rsquo;re willing to wait for inspiration to strike.</p>

<p>To help people make informed decisions, I believe we can apply artificial intelligence to social media and report the results. An analysis of (semi-) public information including shared/retweeted links, blog posts/comments, and anything we &ldquo;like&rdquo; would certainly lead to conclusions about the person. If you analyze a person in this way, you could determine interests and broadÂ competencies. This report alone would be powerful, but we could extend the system to match careers, people, places, etc. that match the interests. Now, the aimless 20-something has a jumping-off point that is completely personalized.</p>

<p>As far as I know, this does not yet exist. The closest thing I can find is <a title="my6sense" href="http://www.my6sense.com/website/a/MainPage" target="_blank">my6sense</a>, which mines your social streams and helps you find the best content. Does anyone know of an instantiation of what I&rsquo;m talking about? Would you be willing to use such a system? How would you improve it? Let me know!</p>

      <p>After several months of hard work and mental drain, Andrea and I spontaneously decided to take a trip. We scoured the web for deals and ended up in Belgium and Holland a couple weeks later. We had a wonderful 10 days! The weather was perfect; the people were nice; the food was great; all around wonderful! I feel reinvigorated :)</p>

      <p>As the Fall semester starts, the MPC group has gained a few new students. As is tradition in the lab, we engage in a great deal of intellectual discourseÂ about the world, culture, programming, science, research, and academia. Over the years I&rsquo;ve been gifted some amazing articles, so I thought I&rsquo;d document them here for other academic thinkers, or, at worst, my own memory.</p>

<p>As an aside, I appreciate when professors make use of their tenure and take bold, public stances (though I don&rsquo;t always agree with the stance). Some of these articles are edgy, but they&rsquo;ll make you think.</p>

<p>I have another few essays to post, however, they don&rsquo;t quite fit the general theme here so I&rsquo;ll save them for later.Â Without further ado, the reading list (in no particular order):</p>

The Pitchfork 500 is actually a 500 song review from the music geniuses at <a title="Pitchfork" href="http://www.pitchfork.com" target="_blank">Pitchfork.com</a>; Grooveshark allows users to create and share playlists, so people have taken the review and created the accompanying playlist.</p>

<p>For the past week I&rsquo;ve been listening to the 500 song playlist that covers virtually every musical style from 1978 to now. I&rsquo;m deleting roughly &frac12; the songs, but I&rsquo;m discovering a lot of great new stuff, old favorites, and deeper tracks from bands that I knew little about.

      <p>Phishing is presumably big business (although <a title="Dancho Danchev's analysis of profit in the digital black market" href="http://www.zdnet.com/blog/security/microsoft-study-debunks-profitability-of-the-underground-economy/3522" target="_blank">maybe not</a>). Because email is very cheap to send, phishing has a low barrier for entry. Usually, Gmail&rsquo;s spam filter is so accurate that I don&rsquo;t see the phishing emails, however, recently some Blizzard themed messages have gotten through. I get the impression that the emails are crafted by foreigners who lack the finesse necessary to deceive people&mdash;a good thing, no doubt. As with most pursuits, the devil is in the details. Let me illustrate with the most recent email to pierce Gmail&rsquo;s phishing armor:</p>

<p>I like the use of Â® andÂ â¢! Those are definitely nice touches. However, Blizzard begins by greeting you with the name on the account. Moving on, the CD key should have dashes. Whoops. Next, we see &ldquo;Battle.n Account &ndash; Or Create at Battle.net Account.&rdquo; Within a few words, they misspell Battle.net and give you the proper spelling. Then there&rsquo;s the gratuitous use ofÂ capitalization throughout. Seen here on &ldquo;Account,&rdquo; &ldquo;Or,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Create.&rdquo; Throughout, there are a few small, unprofessional and inconsistent bits, like the lack of carriage return between items 3 and 4. Then &ldquo;CDKey&rdquo; is lacking a space&hellip; Another awesome failure: the &ldquo;Vis<strong><em>t</em></strong>a&rdquo; credit card type! A couple lines lower, the &ldquo;Shipping Tax&rdquo; itemized seems off.</p>

<p>To be fair, if you were expecting a StarCraft email (sadly, the phishers are two weeks late) and gave only Â a quick glance, the email could work. It is apparently sent by Blizzard Entertainment! However, digging deeper in the email header we see more incorrect details:</p>

<blockquote>from    Blizzard Entertainment

<p>Mailed by hotmail? Phishy. Details, details!</p>

<p>Also, it&rsquo;s important to hover over links before following them&hellip; This is probably my favorite part: &ldquo;wowsuppor-check-blizzard.com.&rdquo; I guess wowsuppor<strong><em>t</em></strong>-check-blizzard.com was already registered :) And, of course, official Blizzard emails direct you to us.battle.net instead of blizzard.com. Details!</p>

<p>Another detail that reeks of fraud is the use of &ldquo;WoW&rdquo;/&ldquo;wow&rdquo;, which refers to another Blizzard product, World of Warcraft. Account management, StarCraft II, and World of Warcraft blend into one weak attempt at phishing.</p>

<p>I believe that every critique should come with a suggestion, so here&rsquo;s my suggestion: buy a legitimate copy of StarCraft II and copy the official email exactly, changing only the link (from official site to your faked site). Then, replicate their website and direct people to the fake. To Blizzard&rsquo;s credit they do not make copying the page easy because they cleverly use dynamically rendered Ajax elements with obfuscated JavaScript and XSLT. They also have a lot of content and they update the pages regularly. Another idea: direct them to your domain, infect their computer with malware, and quickly forward them to battle.net so they&rsquo;re none the wiser.</p>

<p>If you want to step up to the big leagues, you&rsquo;ll have to concentrate on the details!</p>
