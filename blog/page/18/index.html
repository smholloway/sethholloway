      <p>I recently discovered the <a title="Software Engineering Genealogy" href="http://people.engr.ncsu.edu/txie/sefamily.htm" target="_blank">Software Engineering Academic Genealogy</a>. For those outside the ivory tower, this genealogy mirrors standard human breeding records. In the not-so-distant future I will be an indentation under <a title="Christine's awesomely outdated page :)" href="http://www.ece.utexas.edu/%7Ejulien/" target="_blank">Christine Julien</a>, below <a title="Gruia Catalin Roman" href="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/%7Eroman" target="_blank">Gruia-Catalin Roman</a>. Standard genealogical terms apply in the academic version as well; for example, Christine is my academic parent.</p>

<p>Just as in humans, breed history can be an important determination of future success. A descendant of a well-known researcher will have high expectations to perform like their academic ancestor, but this is also a great way to position oneself for the job one desires. For example, if you want to be a professor, ensure that your advisor has graduated other students who became faculty. Unfortunately, this way of thinking favors older professors and can make it hard for new faculty to establish themselves despite their fresh ideas and tenacity. As with humans, genealogy comes with no guarantees! Individuals create their own track records. An advisor&rsquo;s personality and research should play into the perspective student&rsquo;s decision. Find an <a title="Sensor Enablement for the Average Programmer" href="http://mpc.ece.utexas.edu/SEAP/" target="_blank">interesting topic</a> and do it well!</p>

<p>While we&rsquo;re on the subject, another fun genealogical term borrowed by scholars is &ldquo;<a title="Luis Von Ahn discusses his &quot;imbred&quot; hiring" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wXsQxZLEEc" target="_blank">academic imbreeding</a>&rdquo; or &ldquo;academic incest&rdquo; which refers to the taboo practice of hiring people from the host university.</p>

<p>And that concludes today&rsquo;s lecture. Visit me in my office hours if you have any questions. Have a nice weekend!</p>

      <p>As I&rsquo;ve said <a title="Seth Holloway: World Religion Visual" href="http://sethholloway.com/blog/2009/07/12/world-relgions-visual/" target="_blank">before</a>, I&rsquo;m a sucker for effective visualizations. In this age of &ldquo;<a title="Wikipedia: American Energy Independence" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_energy_independence" target="_blank">energy independence</a>&rdquo; I was really taken aback by this visual: the energy generation, transmission, and consumption in the U.S. Given the complexity of the information and sheer volume of data to present, I think this visual does an excellent job. (Other interesting visuals are available on the Lawrence Livermore site <a title="Energy at Lawrence Livermore" href="https://eed.llnl.gov/flow/" target="_blank">here</a>. Thanks to <a title="Drew Stovall" href="http://www.dstovall.com/" target="_blank">Drew</a> for sharing this with me.)</p>

<p><a href="https://eed.llnl.gov/flow/images/LLNL_Energy_Chart300.jpg"><img title="Energy Generation, Transmission, and Consumption" src="https://eed.llnl.gov/flow/images/LLNL_Energy_Chart300.jpg" alt="U.S. Energy Generation, Transmission, and Consumption" width="550" height="400" /></a></p>

<p>Notice how little energy alternative sources are producing. Also, notice that we&rsquo;re losing a ton of energy to transmission. In fact, if we could halve transmission losses we could eliminate all imports.</p>

<p>Does anything else stand out to you? More notable points than mine? Is the graphic missing data that you would like to see? Is energy independence truly achievable?</p>

<p>The talk covers the basics of a CAPTCHA (the hard-to-read words that verify you are human when signing up for online accounts) then discusses the recaptcha. The recaptcha pairs two random English words together so it can yield some funky phrases such as the &ldquo;desert voter&rdquo; shown below. (Watch the video for much better pairings!) The recaptcha uses one known word and one word that cannot be read by a machine. By distributing the otherwise unreadable word to multiple people, von Ahn is able to effortlessly digitize the written word. I respect and admire the ingenuity here. Dr. von Ahn simultaneously repels spammers and digitizes books!</p>

<p>J.P. Knight left a much easier solution in the comments. If you want to see all of your citations the easy way, simply put the \nocite{*} command into your latex file as seen below.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m currently writing my dissertation (technically my proposal) in <a title="LaTeX Official Page" href="http://www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX</a> (think Microsoft Word without the WYSIWYG interface). As I&rsquo;m searching for citations, I am overwhelmed at the number of sources in my bibtex file. Rather than staring at the bland, perhaps bloated, syntax with curly braces, spaces, and commas, I created a little script that would let me see how the citations will look in the paper&ndash;in a nice PDF bibliography. Here, I present seeAllCitations.sh which takes in your bibtex file as an argument and creates a file with all of your potential citations. After the script completes, just &ldquo;compile&rdquo; the file as you normally would and open the resulting pdf/dvi.</p>

<blockquote>#!/bin/sh

# Check input for one argument
if [ $# -ne 1 ]; then
echo &#8220;Please input your .bib file as an argument&#8221;
echo &#8220;Example: ./seeAllCitations.sh proposal.bib&#8221;
exit 1

#  Create the file
echo &#8220;Creating seeAllCitations.tex that will allow you to see all citations.&#8221;

<p>See any mistakes? Was that at all helpful? Do you have a different (read: better) method for checking your citations?</p>

      <p>&ldquo;When do you wet your toothbrush?&rdquo; an uncle once asked me. I don&rsquo;t remember how it came up, but my reply was &ldquo;before and after I put on the toothpaste.&rdquo; He quickly replied, &ldquo;Then you&rsquo;re a freak!&rdquo; I paused to think about my action and, after some rumination, I stated my case: &ldquo;I wet the toothbrush first so the paste goes onto soft bristles. I wet the toothbrush again to soften the toothpaste.&rdquo; Of course, doing this wetting ritual only once would achieve the same effect, but it&rsquo;s my routine!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve always been a bit of an optimizer: I try to accomplish the most tasks in the shortest amount of time, so it struck me odd that I was wasting time, not to mention water, by wetting my toothbrush twice. Even now, I catch myself falling into the old routine. Old habits die hard, but we must keep improving!</p>

<p>So, am I a freak for wetting the bristles twice? When do you wet your toothbrush? What are you doing more efficiently now? What routine can you simlpy not break?</p>

      <p>I&rsquo;m a generalist. I love life. I love people. I love technology. I love sports. I love games. I love philosophy (religion, politics, physics, etc.). I love food. I love music. I love love. I love lists ;-)</p>

<p>Growing up I heard a lot of conventional wisdom that being well-rounded is good. However, as I&rsquo;ve gotten older I&rsquo;ve felt a shocking lack of suggestions to be broad. Perhaps my senses are more keen at only finding differences, but I have found numerous proponents of specialization. However, I&rsquo;m a damn good generalist so I&rsquo;ll have to content myself with hopes of being a polymath.</p>

<p>Watching Nathan Myhrvold&rsquo;s TED talk (embedded below) gave me hope that it is okay to be broad. From archeology to penguin poop to barbeque, he does it all with nary a thread to tie the activities together. Rather than try to define himself as a computer scientist or a researcher, he simply does what he enjoys.</p>

<p>What do you think? Are you broad or specific? Is it working for you? Is there a winning formula for either (specializing or generalizing)? Myhrvold is one example of a generalist who succeeded, are there others?</p>

      <p>Does anyone know of a website or method to be notified when your favorite artist is coming to town?</p>

<p>For example, I&rsquo;d love to see <a title="Mike Doughty" href="http://www.mikedoughty.com/" target="_blank">Mike Doughty</a>, <a title="Ben Folds" href="http://www.benfolds.com/" target="_blank">Ben Folds</a>, and <a title="They Might Be Giants... or..." href="http://www.tmbg.com/" target="_blank">They Might Be Giants</a> in concert, but I always miss the ticket sales. I&rsquo;ve tried to check their websites periodically, but I forget for a few months then miss the show. I&rsquo;ve listened for announcements on the radio, but I do not listen to the radio consistently enough. Most recently, I&rsquo;ve subscribed to RSS feeds from my favorite artists and this method is working, although I feel it is suboptimal.</p>

<p>My brother just mentioned a similar experience where he missed seeing the guitar-thumping virtuoso <a title="Andy McKee" href="http://www.andymckee.com/" target="_blank">Andy McKee</a>. (If you don&rsquo;t know what I mean when I say &ldquo;guitar-thumping virtuoso,&rdquo; check Andy out below.)</p>

<p>While not the pressing issue in the world, not receiving relevant and timely updates for artists seems to be a common issue. Is there a solution? Show your 1337ness and help me out. Any tips would be appreciated!</p>

      <p>Keyloggers are rampant! They are the most prolific trojan horse and they can easily transmit your passwords to bad guys. They&rsquo;re simple and effective.</p>

<p>Keyloggers work by intercepting and transmitting keystrokes, so a simple countermeasure is to avoid keystrokes. While this is impractical as a general approach, you can add a hint more security to your workflow by inputting passwords (or even bits of a password) via an on-screen keyboard.</p>

<p>In Windows, it is very easy to turn on an on-screen keyboard:</p>

<blockquote><a title="Microsoft: directions to use on-screen keyboard" href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/using/accessibility/oskturnonuse.mspx" target="_blank">Start -&gt; All Programs -&gt; Accessories -&gt; Accessibility -&gt; On-Screen Keyboard</a></blockquote>


<p>Once the keyboard is up, simply set focus on an application then use your mouse to press the keys on the on-screen keyboard.</p>

<p>Does anyone have evidence that on-screen keyboards are also vulnerable? Any other simple security tips?</p>

      <p>Better late than never, right?</p>

<p>Last Sunday I returned from Vancouver where I was attending the International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE). I met a lot of great and interesting people. A few that stand out are</p>

<ul>
<li>Sherlock Licorish - the soft-spoken researcher from Guyana who told me I was an academic</li>
<li><a title="Justin Erenkrantz -- UCI student and ASF pres" href="http://www.erenkrantz.com/" target="_blank">Justin Erenkrantz</a> - the President of the Apache Software Foundation who was really down to Earth and cool</li>
<li><a title="Andy Ko -- CMU student to UW prof" href="http://faculty.washington.edu/ajko/" target="_blank">Andy Ko</a> - a professor finishing up his first year at University of Washington. Andy was an all-around great person: articulate, helpful, funny</li>
</ul>


<p>I also had the honor of hanging out with a couple esteemed colleagues, <a title="Drew Stovall" href="http://www.dstovall.com" target="_blank">Drew Stovall</a> and <a title="Hyrum Wright" href="http://www.hyrumwright.org" target="_blank">Hyrum Wright</a>, and my wonderful wife.</p>

<p>And a big thanks to the person that made this all possible, <a title="Christine's awesomely outdated page :)" href="http://users.ece.utexas.edu/~julien/" target="_blank">Dr. Christine Julien</a>.</p>

<p>Vancouver was an amazing city! I feel extremely glad to be able to see the Pacific Northwest in the late Spring/early Summer. We experienced temperatures  in the 40s to 70 with ample sunshine and a light breeze. By most definitions, near perfect weather. In the eight days we were there it only rained once! Of course, that was the day we were on an open-top zodiac chasing whales, but the experience was too cool to let a little rain get in the way (my retrospective opinion, not the opinion I held while freezing on the chilly waters of the Pacific Ocean). We had awesome Japanese food, terrific Chinese food, a tasty bubble tea, and other ethnic fare that was totally worthwhile.</p>

<p>Before ICSE, we were in Madison, WI to see my sister graduate with her PhD. Her research was about DBMSs on flash disks. Congratulations to her on this momentous ocassion. We&rsquo;re all very proud!</p>
