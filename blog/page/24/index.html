      <p>I was just cleaning the apartment and I realized that my simple life is full of clutter&ndash;every week I pick up the same few items and throw them away. Among the offenders are</p>

<ul>
<li>Plastic bags (groceries)</li>
<li>Plastic water bottles</li>
<li>Magazines</li>
<li>Junk mail</li>
</ul>


<p>Most of those can be recycled&hellip; somewhere, somehow&hellip; Unfortunately, I do not have any convenient way of disposing of these items in a more environmentally-friendly way (and as much as I care about the environment, I don&rsquo;t want to store boxes of stuff, find the drop-off locations, and then make multiple separate trips). I&rsquo;ve been searching (reading and brainstorming) for clever ways to use these items, but I have not found much. <a title="tips to improve your life, or waste your time" href="http://www.lifehack.org/">Lifehack</a> had an article on <a title="10 ways to reuse plastic bags" href="http://www.lifehack.org/articles/lifehack/10-uses-for-plastic-grocery-bags.html" target="_blank">10 ways to reuse plastic bags</a>. If you have any ideas, please let me know!</p>

      <p>My father once told me that I should reply, &ldquo;Unbelievable!&rdquo; anytime someone queried about my mood. The logic behind this was simple: the definition of &ldquo;unbelievable&rdquo; can fit any situation and people interpret the response positively. In general, people like to be around fun, positive people, so your &ldquo;unbelievable&rdquo; reply starts you off on the right foot.</p>

<p>Today, like most days, I&rsquo;m unbelievable, and I hope you are too!</p>

      <p>The joke goes that 98% of people consider themselves good drivers. Driving is such a tangible effort: everyone over the age of 16 can drive. Because that captures such a large percentage of the population, there are a number of ideas about how to drive. As I see it, traffic laws should be obeyed in spirit rather than completely literally.</p>

<p>Basic driving rules:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Keep right!</strong> If someone is going slower than you would like to go, pass them on the left and return to the right</li>
<li><strong>Do not drive on the heel of another car!</strong> This goes with number 1 but represents a separate idea to which attention should be paid. do not hover behind a nearby vehicle: it is obnoxious to anyone trying to pass and it is dangerous because you may be in someone&rsquo;s blind spot.</li>
<li><strong>Know the speed limit at all times!</strong> Going under the speed limit hurts both you and others on the road. the government chooses a speed limit based on safety concerns and the average speed observed in an area. do not try to circumvent the law and drive at a lower speed&ndash;they&rsquo;ve already set the lower limit for you. Going less than speed limit increases your commute time and likely increases the amount of gasoline wasted on idling. By driving slowly you are also slowing the general flow of traffic so your decision triggers a loss of time for everyone around you.</li>
<li><strong>Travel at the speed limit to 7mph over speed limit at all times!</strong> In addition to knowing the speed limit, driving at 0-7 mph over the speed limit insulates you from 95% of speeding tickets and gets you places faster. Some basic calculations. One ticket a year costs an average of $100 ($50 administrative + $50 for defensive driving). If you are paid $20 an hour, the ticket is worthwhile if you can save 5 hours of time a year from driving. If you drive an average of 20 miles a day, 300 days a year, then you drive 6000 miles a year. with an average posted speed limit of 45mph, driving an average of 47mph will save 5.67 hours over the course of a year without appreciably increasing your chances to get a ticket. Driving the extra 2mph is clearly worth your effort.</li>
<li><strong>Get happy!</strong> Leave the road rage at home. If you accomplish this, please tell me how!</li>
</ul>


<p>The other day <a title="Andrea Mire Holloway home" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andreamholloway">Andrea</a> pointed out a disturbing trend: people driving with earphones in (<em>cough iPod cough</em>). Initially, I agreed without much thought; however, she went on to say that the disturbing part is that even people with nice cars are doing it. After she pointed it out, I&rsquo;ve seen people in all kinds of cars from Fords to Mercedez throwing caution to the wind and driving with deafening music pumping directly into their eardrums. As a corollary, not a full rule, listen to music through your cars radio!</p>

<p>I imagine I&rsquo;m missing some other rules, but I think this is a good start.</p>

      <p>Are you an application developer? Do not do write applications that steal focus (i.e. if your email client pops up without you attempting to open the program). That was standard in 1998, but not in 2008. Like viral ads, applications that steal focus have no place in today&rsquo;s world: they pollute the landscape and disrupt workflows.</p>

<p>And while I&rsquo;m on the subject of poorly-designed applications, if you have an input field on the GUI, please make the field active from the time the GUI loads.</p>

      <p>Being a researcher and techie myself, I have seen my fair share of technologies that will change the world and innovation that will never leave the lab.</p>

<p>I once read that the easiest was to reduce your daily stress is to shorten your commute. Everyone is annoyed while driving, but we cannot easily reduce our reliance on cars. I know that innovations are attainable with our current technology, so why has no one introduced changes to our roadways and vehicles? Are the technologies too expensive? Or is something more sinister at hand?</p>

<p>In this always-on world people long to be connected at all times; the commute is an inevitable impediment to staying connected and therefor causes us stress. Driving gets us from point A to point B: from one place we need or want to be to another. The journey is merely the time between now and then and is rarely pleasurable.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve found that riding my bike is a great way to get from A to B while simultaneously exercising, clearing my head, and waking up. However, biking is not always possible or practical. This is where we have a major opportunity to improve life with technology; whether that is car driving themselves or the back of the car in front of us has a display on it (for our enjoyment), there are so many good ideas that could make the driving public happier.</p>

      <p>Am I or will I ever be, one of those people who ever so nonchalantly mentions their extravagant travels and exotic friends? Sitting at a coffee shop one day I overheard a woman discussing all the wonderful things she had seen. Her audience, apparently an old friend, was less than impressed as the old hen prattled on with a constant stream of auto-laudations. I&rsquo;m fortunate: I&rsquo;ve led a very interesting life and experienced amazing things, but I do not want to bore my friends with inane details and persistent bragging. Travel is not a unique topic here&ndash;I&rsquo;ve heard people brag about experiences from guitar to shopping. I&rsquo;m left wondering how to talk about an exciting life without coming off like a braggart.</p>

<p>People should feel free to talk about subjects that interest them, but they should take note of social cues and change subjects more regularly. Beyond that, we should be confident but humble; approach conversation as two-way exchange of knowledge rather that a chance to tell every great story you have. My thoughts are still gestating, but I think this is a good starting point!</p>

      <p>April 17, 2008 is the day that the world will remember something great: Seth Holloway&rsquo;s first bike ride to campus. Despite living further from campus than ever before (and that&rsquo;s saying something since I&rsquo;ve been here for 7 years), I took the plunge and rode my bike today.</p>

<p>The five miles took thirty minutes in traffic. I arrived on campus fully awake and sweaty; a combination I had never experienced so early before. My only gripe was a Volvo-driving soccer mom who hugged the curb and kept me from riding up to the stoplight along the curb. All the other drivers were courteous and kind to this noob-biker.</p>

<p>As I get more fit, tune my bike better, and hit lights at the right time I think I could shave off five minutes pretty easily.  Here&rsquo;s to Austin weather staying pleasant enough for bike riding for weeks to come!</p>

<p>Thanks to Mike for excellent advice on the route and helping me to get comfortable riding my bike. Additional thanks to Tony and Dave for helping to acclimate me with the nuances of riding a bike to campus.</p>

      <p>Some people assert that cell phones are the rudest device ever unleashed on the world. While this may true, we cannot forget that all the people talking on cell phones are being more social while simultaneously being less social. Every sorority girl flapping her gums when she should have both hands on the wheel is communicating with another person. Every communication brings us closer to one another and closer to ourselves. In that regard, all these rude phone conversations that keep a person from interacting with the outside world are bringing the conversants closer to a select few. All in all I have felt the cold shoulder hefted upon me when someone chooses to speak on their cell phone instead of to me, but I have to think positively and credit them for interacting at all&ndash;unlike those iPod listeners&hellip;</p>

      <p>One of my goals in purchasing <a title="official site of seth holloway, duh" href="http://www.sethholloway.com">sethholloway.com</a> is to carve out my own niche on the Internet superhighway&ndash;the series of tubes invented by a politician from Tin-uh-see. However, as I google myself (which is even dirtier than it sounds) I can&rsquo;t help but feel that my job is not yet done. Many of my friends and peers have amazingly unique names, for example &ldquo;Jason&rdquo; or &ldquo;Steve,&rdquo; yet they are the top search results when you search for them!</p>

<p>All my life I thought I was unique. I recently discovered that everybody poops and more than two people per city are named Seth. Unfortunately for me, &ldquo;Seth Holloway&rdquo; is more popular statistically than &ldquo;Seth &lt;any other last name&gt;&rdquo; and as a result, there are a lot more Seth Holloways out there than I realized. But you know what? I&rsquo;m the only one with <a title="official site of seth holloway, duh" href="http://www.sethholloway.com">www.sethholloway.com</a>! :-p</p>

<p>If you, fair visitor, are another Seth Holloway please create <a title="official site of seth holloways, duh" href="http://sethholloways.com">sethholloways.com</a> so we can differentiate ourselves. If you are looking for another Seth Holloway, I wish you luck on your quest.</p>
