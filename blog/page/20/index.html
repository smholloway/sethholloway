      <p>I hope my lovely, intelligent readers do not mind the two new ad panels (at the bottom of individual posts and in the sidebar); RSS readers should not notice any changes. This was a fun technical project that may make me a dollar over about twenty years :)</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s how I added ads to the sidebar and the end of single posts in my WordPress blog. You may be able to do it easily with a plugin, such as one of the <a title="Wordpress Plugins for AdSense" href="http://www.quickonlinetips.com/archives/2006/11/10-best-wordpress-plugins-for-google-adsense/" target="_blank">ten featured in this article</a>, but I chose to do it manually to learn more.</p>

<p>For ease, I used two tabs. In one tab I generated ads and another tab was used to edit pages.</p>

<p><strong>Generating Ads.</strong> Google makes it easy with <a title="Google AdSense" href="https://www.google.com/adsense/" target="_blank">AdSense</a>. You can see your options for ads <a title="AdSense Ad Formats" href="https://www.google.com/adsense/static/en_US/AdFormats.html" target="_blank">here</a>. First, sign up for AdSense then enter the AdSense Setup page, the <a title="Google AdSense Get Ads" href="https://www.google.com/adsense/adsense-products" target="_blank">Get Ads tab</a>. Both my units are AdSense for Content; one Ad Unit and one Link Unit. After choosing the options I wanted, I was given sample code. I copied this code and switched to the other tab.</p>

<p><strong>Editing Pages.</strong> First, get to the Theme Editor:</p>

<ul>
<li>Log into the administrative panel.</li>
<li>Click the <em>Design</em> tab</li>
<li>Click the <em>Theme Editor</em></li>
</ul>


<p>I put the banner ad at the bottom of the single post. To do so I copied the generated code then performed these steps:</p>

<ul>
<li>Selected <em>Single Post (single.php)</em></li>
<li>Pasted the following code above the line &ldquo;&lt;?php get_footer(); ?&gt;&rdquo;:</li>
</ul>


<blockquote>&lt;!&#8212; Ad support. Added by Seth Holloway on Jan 9, 2009 &#8212;&gt;
&lt;div id=&#8221;ads&#8221;&gt;
&lt;script type=&#8221;text/javascript&#8221;&gt;&lt;!&#8211;
google_ad_client = &#8220;pub-2003017988956692&#8221;;
/* 728x90, created 1/8/09 */
google_ad_slot = &#8220;5798236936&#8221;;
google_ad_width = 728;
google_ad_height = 90;
//&#8211;&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script type=&#8221;text/javascript&#8221;
src=&#8221;http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js&#8221;&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</blockquote>


<p>For the sake of looks, I then needed to edit the stylesheet in the following manner:</p>

<ul>
<li>Selected the <em>Stylesheet (style.css)</em></li>
<li>Added this to the code:</li>
</ul>


<blockquote>/* Ad support. Added by Seth Holloway on Jan 9, 2009 */
#ads {
text-align: center;
}</blockquote>


<p>I then generated the sidebar link unit, copied the code, and followed these steps:</p>

<ul>
<li>Selected the <em>Sidebar (sidebar.php)</em></li>
<li>Pasted the generated ad unit to the code above the final &ldquo;&lt;/ul&gt;&rdquo;:</li>
</ul>


<blockquote>&lt;!&#8212; Ad support. Added by Seth Holloway on Jan 9, 2009 &#8212;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;script type=&#8221;text/javascript&#8221;&gt;&lt;!&#8211;
google_ad_client = &#8220;pub-2003017988956692&#8221;;
/* 120x90, created 1/8/09 */
google_ad_slot = &#8220;2887058896&#8221;;
google_ad_width = 120;
google_ad_height = 90;
//&#8211;&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script type=&#8221;text/javascript&#8221;
src=&#8221;http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js&#8221;&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;</blockquote>


<p>And voila! We now have two unobtrusive ads on sethholloway.com.</p>

<p>Later, I would like improve the relevance of the ads and to add Digg, Reddit, and Sharethis buttons.</p>

<p>Any tips for items missing from the blog? Did you notice the ads? Do you hate them?</p>

      <p>I&rsquo;ve seen a lot of loading screens recently: in video games, movies, TV shows, cable box resets, iPod power ons, etc. Most are effective yet bland&ndash;a logo and a progress bar. These brief moments break my attention, but do not offer enough time for me to switch context and do something else. Producers and developers could use this time to educate and inform users while simultaneously keeping people engaged. Watching <a title="IMDB: Once" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0907657/" target="_blank">Once</a>? You&rsquo;ll get to read a blurb about the star, <a title="Wikipedia: Glen Hansard" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glen_Hansard" target="_blank">Glen Hansard</a>. Playing World of Warcraft? Read the storyline for the zone you&rsquo;re entering while you wait!</p>

<p>Taking the idea a step further, a platform could allow for loading screen customizations. Imagine if your iPhone had a common thread across all applications! With the aggregate time you could read a book, polish your vocab, increase reaction speeds, read the latest headlines, learn a language, or anything else that can be chunked into simple, discrete pieces! I&rsquo;d love to get a couple lines of Atlas Shrugged in every loading screen. It&rsquo;s not the fastest way to read a book, but I&rsquo;d get through it (eventually :))!</p>

<p>The code necessary to change the loading screens should be easy: add a variable to track the message number and modify the load screen to accept a variable corresponding to the message number; then increment the message number every time you display a load screen.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve seen the idea partially in action; for example, while loading a song in Rock Band, trivia is displayed. The problem is that the pool of messages is very slim and never updated. The platforms for this game (PS3, Xbox360, and Wii) are all Internet-enabled so it should be possible to periodically update or replace the stash of messages.</p>

<p>Another (somewhat) similar service, <a title="Daily Lit Dot Com" href="http://www.dailylit.com/" target="_blank">Daily Lit</a>, allows you to read books in email messages or RSS feeds. Daily Lit provides a proof-of-concept demonstrating first, that it is possible and second, that people want this form of entertainment.</p>

<p>What do you think? Would you use this service? What would you want in your loading screens?</p>

      <p>I love architecture and green building! I&rsquo;m not as well-informed as I should be, but green homes are an area I would love to explore later in life. One of the best ideas I&rsquo;ve seen is the <a title="Wikipedia: Passive House" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_house" target="_blank">passive house</a> (Passivhaus). Passive homes seek to retain the home&rsquo;s heat with little or no extra energy usage. They achieve the effect by combining several features, notably superinsulation, a special airflow system, and optimized floorplans.</p>

<p>The NY Times has a nice <a title="Low heating bills and a comfortable temperate" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/27/world/europe/27house.html?_r=1" target="_blank">article on passively heated homes</a> and a family living in one in Germany. Germany is important to the tale because they are pioneering the practice, and many of the worlds 15,000 passive houses are in Germany. Unfortunately, America is slow to adopt similar practices. One explanation is America&rsquo;s population center in warmer-weather climates. Because the passive house is designed to retain heat, it would probably not deliver a desirable effect in the summer in Austin :)</p>

<p>America&rsquo;s green building code, the <a title="Wikipedia: LEED" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leadership_in_Energy_and_Environmental_Design" target="_blank">Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED)</a> standard, is lagging behind in achieving energy independence. (More information can be found at the <a title="USGBC LEED Standard" href="http://www.usgbc.org/DisplayPage.aspx?CategoryID=19">US Green Building Council site</a>.) LEED is more about using reusable supplies than it is about living off the grid. In any case, the  idea and innovation in the passive house brings me joy!</p>

<p>What do you think? Would you live in a Passivhaus? Is it worth an additional 5% upfront in order to never pay another utility bill?</p>

      <p>I was reluctant to post about this because it is depressing, but it is also very important. You should strive to be important to your friends, to be remembered favorably.</p>

<p>It was nine years ago today that my mother called to tell me about a bus crash in Colorado. I was 17 and shrugged off the bus crash; &ldquo;who cares?&rdquo; I thought. An hour later I heard a knock on the door. I went downstairs, opened the door, and found three of my friends hanging their heads. As they raised their chins to look at me I noticed puffy eyes. One quietly said, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s dead. Chris is dead.&rdquo; I froze in an overwhelming rush or emotions and quickly started bawling. We all comforted one another, and after a minute I calmed down enough to thank them for telling me. We then drove to a mutual friend&rsquo;s house and suffered together.</p>

<p>Chris Scarberry, one of my best friends, had <a title="Local news coverage" href="http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4191/is_/ai_n9963337" target="_blank">died in a terrible bus accident</a> <a href="http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-67430667.html" target="_blank">that killed three people</a>. All this just days before Christmas after a wonderful ski trip. Needless to say, I did not have a merry Christmas. The young punk in me was humbled. The flippant &ldquo;who cares?&rdquo; came back to bite me. I cared. I cared a lot. I was depressed for months. I struggled to find meaning. I still do. It was terrible and unfair.</p>

<p>Mortality hit me and I realized I had to make life count. I also saw what it meant to be important to your friends. Relationships make life worth living. Chris was a great person and a great friend; he&rsquo;s been very influential in my life. The memory of Chris lives on in me as I follow the path he and I were on together.</p>

<p>Are you the kind of friend that someone would write about nine years later?</p>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/tech-star-seth-goldstein/">Tech Star: Seth Goldstein</a></h1>
      <p>Technologists affect the world tremendously, but America does not value the contribution nearly as much as they do pop stars and athletes. We must change this! If technologists were more prominent, students would have a wider range of role models and education would be taken more seriously.</p>

<p>In an effort to give worthwhile technologists the spotlight, I&rsquo;d like to share one of my favorite technology researchers: <a title="Seth Copen Goldstein" href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~seth/" target="_blank">Seth Goldstein</a>, professor at CMU. Beyond having an awesome first name, Dr. Goldstein is working on world-changing, futuristic research: <a title="Wikipedia: Claytronics" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claytronics" target="_blank">Claytronics</a>. Claytronics is a form of <a title="Wikipedia: Programmable Matter" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmable_matter" target="_blank">programmable matter</a>. composed of claytronics atoms, catoms. Catoms are tiny, autonomous sensors that, together, create emergent behavior. The end goal of Claytronics is to allow pario&ndash;a new media that recreates three-dimensional data (just as a radio recreates sound and TV recreates video).</p>

<p>Claytronics is the talk of the town, getting featured on the <a title="Claytronics on CMU" href="http://www.cmu.edu/corporate/news/2007/features/claytronics.shtml" target="_blank">CMU site</a>, <a title="Clatronics in Make" href="http://blog.makezine.com/archive/2008/02/claytronics_nanoscale_rob.html" target="_blank">Make Magazine</a>, <a title="Clatronics on robots.net" href="http://robots.net/article/1530.html" target="_blank">Robots.net</a>, and <a title="Claytronics on WorldChangingBlog" href="http://www.worldchanging.com/archives/002885.html" target="_blank">WorldChanging.com</a>. CNN boldly claimed that <a title="Claytronics on CNN" href="http://money.cnn.com/magazines/business2/business2_archive/2007/05/01/8405653/index.htm" target="_blank">Claytronics is the true next-generation of robotics</a>. These articles are fairly shallow, so I encourage you to read <a title="Claytronics on Google Scholar" href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=claytronic" target="_blank">scholarly articles about Claytronics</a>.</p>

<p>Still confused? Here&rsquo;s a video of a meeting that uses Claytronics to view and dynamically alter a 3D model in real-time.</p>

<object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="425" height="344" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/bcaqzOUv2Ao&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="344" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/bcaqzOUv2Ao&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object>


<p>They are not there yet. Recent progress looks more like this:</p>

<object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="425" height="344" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/fj2v0HcoBr0&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="344" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/fj2v0HcoBr0&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object>


<p>Three catoms are aligning themselves. Currently, manufacturing technologies do not exist to create nanobots. Goldstein sees three distinct periods from now until Claytronics realization: macro, micro, and nano. The macrobots, as seen in the above video, are large and locomote using magnets. Because of their weight and relatively weak attractive forces (magnetic), the catoms can only move in two dimensions. However, as the catoms shrink they will reduce their weight sharply and be able to use other forces to move. Nanobots may work more like this:</p>

<object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="425" height="344" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/qa2aAun16n0&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="344" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/qa2aAun16n0&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object>


<p>The work is on-going. The vision is clear and we are progressing nicely. Claytronics provides an excellent motivating application example for research into manufacturing, communications, robotics, AI, and more. I look forward to a world where pario is a reality. Thanks to a technology star, Seth Goldstein, we will know that world!</p>

      <p>I enjoy simple tasks that have big rewards&ndash;work smarter, not harder. For example, <a title="Seth Holloway: A Smile is Free" href="http://sethholloway.com/blog/?p=386" target="_blank">smile more</a> :)</p>

<p>Another way to be a good person and get noticed (without dramatically altering your way of life) is to leave situations equal to or better than when you found them. Public restrooms would be so much more pleasant if people left them in at least the same state as when they entered. Lift the seat when appropriate; turn off the water&ndash;even if you did not turn it on; compact the trash a little with your paper towel; pick up that piece of trash when you&rsquo;re on the way to the dumpster.</p>

<p>The adage holds for other situations, not just throwing away trash. Looking at someone&rsquo;s code? Add comments when you figure out the algorithm. If someone asks you for help, take a moment to provide a thorough answer or suggestions on where to find the information. Reply to forums if you stumble upon an unanswered question.</p>

<p>Leaving a situation better than you found it is easy, right, and worthwhile. Take the extra moment and help make the world a better place!</p>

<p><em>EDIT</em> 1) Took &ldquo;l&rdquo; out of &ldquo;waterl&rdquo; in second paragraph. Thanks <a title="You know you like it" href="http://michaelboatright.com" target="_blank">Mike</a>! 2) Corrected &ldquo;wortwhile&rdquo; in the paragraph above. Thanks Eddie!</p>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/do-we-need-av-software/">Do we need AV software?</a></h1>
      <p>Do we need AV software? It is naive to think that safe practices will protect you&ndash;there are simply too many ways to get into a system. You need something to protect your computer, and good AV software won&rsquo;t hurt.</p>

<p>I was reading a lifehacker article <a title="Lifehacker: Do you use AV software?" href="http://lifehacker.com/384147/do-you-run-antivirus-software?cpage=2" target="_blank">asking readers about antivirus (AV) software</a>. The range of knowledge conveyed in the comments is ridiculous. Some users claimed they never had a virus. There are known botnets with over a million machines. I doubt that all million machines are owned by a single individual, which means there are multiple users who are either willingly allowing someone to use their machine, or the multiple users are unaware of the heist. With the sophistication of modern viruses (rootkits, automatic replication, dynamic signature changing, etc), it is silly to claim you would even know if you had a virus.</p>

<p>A couple users claim that there had never been a virus for Linux. I don&rsquo;t even know where to start on that one. Definitely false. Any script kiddie could gain access to a Linux system that had not been hardened. There are a number of measures a system administrator can take to mitigate threats on Linux, but not every Linux user is a sys admin. Services like ssh being on by default increase the risks greatly. The power of a Linux command line and access to powerful development tools make subsequent attacks easier to launch.</p>

<p>People seem to define virus strangely. Some viruses like vundo trigger a lot of pop-ups, but won&rsquo;t necessarily crater your system. Other viruses that do not brick your machine are passively collecting information, waiting for further instructions, or launching attacks. You don&rsquo;t even have to open a file to be at risk. You don&rsquo;t even have to be online; infected USB keys (and other input devices) can infect a computer that isn&rsquo;t online.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not just dumb users either. Viruses come from your friends and people you trust. Elaborate social networking hoaxes are being performed everyday, and everyday they get more convincing. Malware distributors have some of the most professional websites online. Their UI and interface design mimic trusted providers so a quick glance will not immediately reveal a problem. You have to realize and appreciate the ingenuity of the nefarious Internet warriors&ndash;they&rsquo;re smart, creative, and talented.</p>

<p>Comparisons have shown that no one piece of antivirus software will catch all viruses, so your best bet is to</p>

<p>1) be safe:</p>

<ul>
<li>Don&rsquo;t open links in emails. Type the URL into the address bar on your own.</li>
<li>Be mindful of what your friends are sending you. Would Suzy really send you a link to get rich quick?</li>
<li>Avoid the worst of the web (pornography, gambling, warez)</li>
</ul>


<p>and 2) run a few different tools:</p>

<ul>
<li><a title="AVG Free" href="http://free.avg.com/download-avg-anti-virus-free-edition" target="_blank">AVG</a> (or <a title="avast! Home Edition (free)" href="http://www.avast.com/eng/download-avast-home.html" target="_blank">avast!</a>) - Antivirus</li>
<li><a title="Peer Guardian 2" href="http://phoenixlabs.org/pg2/" target="_blank">PeerGuardian 2</a> - IP Blocker</li>
<li><a title="Ad-Aware" href="http://www.lavasoft.com/products/ad_aware_free.php" target="_blank">Ad-Aware</a> - Antispyware</li>
</ul>


<p>So do we need AV software? Yes. You can never be totally safe, but you can mitigate your risks. Use common sense, a few tools, and perform frequent backups. Good luck!</p>

      <p>As the semester draws to an end, I am pleased with the progress of the <a title="Students in Software Engineering" href="http://www.edge.utexas.edu/sse/" target="_blank">Students in Software Engineering</a>.  Leading the group has been a very rewarding experience for me, and participating has been great! I enjoyed learning more about my peers&#8217; research as well as hearing some of the professors&#8217; thoughts.</p>

<p>Here are a few statistics from our inaugural semester:</p>

<ul>
<li>Meetings averaged 16 students</li>
<li>We averaged a turnout of over 50% of our target audience (Software Engineering graduate students)</li>
<li>Over 100 different people came to at least one meeting</li>
<li>Hosted the Chairman of the department</li>
<li>We filled the room for two meetings</li>
<li>There were never any donuts left</li>
</ul>


<p>I&rsquo;m very proud to be part of the Students in Software Engineering. The organization has done a phenomenal job of uniting Software Engineers, and we will continue to foster the collaborative, friendly environment. Coming next semester:</p>

<ul>
<li>Greater in-person promotion</li>
<li>Meeting format change: three student presentation (reading groups) and one large meeting per month</li>
<li>A new website</li>
<li>SSE goodies</li>
<li>A few other surprises :)</li>
</ul>


<p>None of this would be possible without the awesome community of students in Software Engineering and my hardworking officers: Justin Enderle, Dave DeAngelis, and Robert Grant. Thanks to you all!</p>

      <p>Automakers should make cars like we make computers.</p>

<p>The US automakers are in trouble. Last week the government agreed to help the big 3 out with $15B. Today, <a title="Should we save Detroit?" href="http://michaelboatright.com/?p=26" target="_blank">Mike commented on the auto industry bailout</a>, expressing an opinion I share for the most part (we should not save Detroit). Americans have voted with their dollars: they do not want American cars. For years the automotive industry has received subsidies for innovation; at this point it seems they frittered the money away. I think auto makers should follow the computer industry. As it stands automobiles are still crafted when they need to be manufactured.</p>

<p>A classic example of craftsmanship versus engineering is in gun production. Before the Industrial Revolution, people handmade every piece of a gun, meticulously massaging the metal and wood until everything fit. Then we specialized in making specific components very uniformly. With uniform components anyone could order the right pieces and assemble a gun.</p>

<p>The computer industry was in a similar position years ago. No, not bankruptcy, but auto makers were not doing well either; they were trying to accommodate myriad different components that led to countless different combinations (many did not work). As <a title="Ryan Harvey on Twitter" href="http://twitter.com/utharvey" target="_blank">Ryan Harvey</a> <a title="I want a hackintosh -- comments" href="http://sethholloway.com/blog/?p=142" target="_blank">commented in my post about Macs</a>, controlling the hardware removes a lot of headaches for anyone sitting above the foundation&ndash;Macs &ldquo;just work&rdquo; in part because they only support a handful of configuration works. However, AMD and Intel have both made their processors more standard (fitting a standard socket) which has led to 1) ease in building computers and 2) innovation in motherboards, graphics cards, and even CPUs. Whenever the hardware works, others can focus on higher layers.</p>

<p>Dell made a killing as a computer-builder without making any of their own parts. They bought components from companies who specialized in those components and produced inexpensive. In the meantime we saw many other companies follow a similar business model and do well. At the same time, hobbyists benefited from the reduced prices and increased technology. Car makers could follow the same arc to everyone&rsquo;s benefit.</p>

<p>The automakers should make cars like we make computers:</p>

<ul>
<li>Define the basic car components.</li>
<li>Make car parts more standard and interoperable.</li>
<li>Create new jobs creating parts, assembling vehicles, modifying cars and car parts, and researching new components.</li>
<li>Offer people premade vehicles at a discount or allow them to customize their components at a premium.</li>
</ul>

      <p>Business Week has a nice <a title="Business Week article" href="http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/content/dec2008/db2008127_817606.htm?campaign_id=rss_daily   " target="_blank">article on how the US is falling behind in cyber security</a>. It&rsquo;s remarkably apropos after a couple high profile security stories earlier this year: <a title="viruses were discovered on Space Station computers infected" href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn14628?feedId=online-news_rss20" target="_blank">computers on the International Space Station</a> and an Iranian IT worker was <a title="Iranian man executed for cybercrime" href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/middle_east/article5258057.ece" target="_blank">executed after being found out as a spy</a>. Are there viruses on US government computers on land? Do we have spies working in our governmental IT department? The answer to both questions is likely yes, so what are we doing about it?</p>

<p>Computers are used for everything! Unfortunately, America is falling behind in security research and, more importantly, countermeasures. I am glad to see the recommendations for President-Elect Obama; I just hope Obama takes the threat to heart and hardens America&rsquo;s cyber security. If we do not, no amount of firepower will protect us from attackers controlling our computers that are controlling the bombs.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>Michael Masnick over at Techdirt <a title="Techdirty" href="http://techdirt.com/articles/20081208/1142253055.shtml" target="_blank">pointed at that everyone knows we need better security</a> and asks what we should do? To start, fund serious research into security. Establish courses on security in schools nationwide so that students can keep up with trends, and learn how to do things properly. Next, allow hobbyists a way to polish their skills within fear of being thrown in jail. Increase the number of jobs in cyber security and take cyber threats seriously. With the education in place and the government in line, we need to harden individuals machines. The government can (help) develop and promote helpful software: firewalls, antivirus, antispam, and intrusion protection applications. Allow Microsoft a one-time ability to patch all users systems and subsidize the operation if need be. Finally, increase the punishment for people operate outside the framework or who pass the buck (posting links to infected sites).</p>
