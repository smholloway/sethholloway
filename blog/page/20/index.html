      <p>I&rsquo;m back from Thailand! After 18 days visiting Andrea in the &ldquo;<a title="Wikipedia: Thailand" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand" target="_blank">Land of the free</a>&rdquo; (Thailand was free from imperialism), I return to my wonderful Austin life. My first immersion in Asia was fantastic; I saw and experienced a ton! I&rsquo;ve now spent at least a few days on five continents, and every culture has such new and interesting traditions. I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;d want to live in Thailand, but the country is worth a visit.</p>

<p>Over on her <a title="Andrea Holloway" href="http://andreaholloway.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">blog</a>, Andrea posted <a title="Andrea Holloway: Lucky Me!" href="http://andreaholloway.wordpress.com/2010/01/11/lucky-me/" target="_blank">her side of the story as well as some pictures</a>. I&rsquo;ll update this post or write some follow-ups to provide more information.</p>

      <p>My sister received her PhD last Spring. She completed the highest level of schooling in a difficult field at one of the top 10 best institutions in the world. Wow! That&rsquo;s awesome by anyone&rsquo;s metrics! Yet, at the terminal degree graduation ceremony (that packed a college basketball arena) attendees were completely civilized (quiet). As Allison strode across the stage I let out a loud whoop! of approval and felt eyes on me for my social outburst.</p>

<p>Months later, this still bothers me. Why don&rsquo;t we (civilized Americans) cheer loudly when people accomplish big things? I&rsquo;m not sure any amount of noise could truly capture the the effort Allison put in and pride that we all felt, but that shouldn&rsquo;t stop us from whooping and hollaring with merriment.</p>

<p>The next time someone you love accomplishes something big, celebrate loud and proud!</p>

      <p>In preparation for an exciting trip to Thailand, I got vaccinated against all (okay, a small subset of) the baddies that seek to share my body. As an American in good living conditions, I have never worried about these ailments, but they are a reality in other countries so I thought it best to be protected. Last Tuesday I was given three shots:</p>

<ul>
<li><a title="Wikipedia: Hepatitis A" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_A" target="_blank">Hepatitis A</a> and <a title="Wikipedia: Hepatitis B" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_B" target="_blank">B</a></li>
<li><a title="Wikipedia: Tetanus" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetanus" target="_blank">Tetanus</a>/<a title="Wikipedia: Diphtheria" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diphtheria" target="_blank">Diphtheria</a></li>
<li><a title="Wikipedia: Influenza" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza" target="_blank">Influenza</a></li>
</ul>


<p>Tuesday morning my arms were sore and I had the sniffles. By afternoon I needed a nap. Wednesday, I was uncontrollably tired&mdash;I slept about 12 hours and lazed around the rest of the day. This felt very much like a weak version of the flu, so I assume the effects were caused by the flu shot.</p>

<p>My fourth vaccine was an oral <a title="Wikipedia: Typhoid" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typhoid" target="_blank">Typhoid</a> vaccine, Vivotif, which consists of four pills&mdash;one every other day. Andrea had taken Vivotif in preparation for her trip, so I had seen one set of potential side effects. To avoid discomfort, I took my pills shortly before bed. My first Vivotif pill was simple; if there were any side effects, I could not differentiate them from those suffered from my three shots. The second pill was okay; I had some dull stomach pains, but nothing awful. After a few days, I saw that the effect seemed to be cumulative. Saturday was unpleasant and Sunday was rough. Monday, my stomach hurt all day and I finished the dose with a feeling of being poisoned, except my body would not, or could not, evacuate the offender. Tuesday I slept almost 12 hours as I had right after receiving the other vaccines; with lingering stomach pain, I ate with care. Today, I&rsquo;m feeling better and hope to be back to 100% by tomorrow.</p>

<p>The moral of the story: vaccines for travel to Thailand make me feel blah, but they&rsquo;re better than the full-on illnesses!</p>

<p>Should I have avoided the vaccines? Have you had similar experiences?</p>

      <p>My wife had a poor hospital experience on her trip to Thailand. After blogging about it, she was inundated with spam comments. I&rsquo;m wondering if bots crawl for the title/body, or if the spam was compliments of cheap Thai labor eager to drum up new business. We&rsquo;ll see if this post yields similar results!</p>

<p>Update: so far, no new spam comments. I guess something is different&hellip;</p>

<p>You are invited to my Ph.D. qualifying exam on Tuesday, November 10 at 2pm in ENS 637. If you are considering a PhD, I encourage you to come and learn the process! The talk should also be entertaining for those of you interested in intelligent environments (e.g., smart homes). These presentations generally last one hour.</p>

<p>Please do not feel obligated to come; if you can make it and you&rsquo;re interested, you are welcome.</p>

<em>What</em>: Simplifying the Programming of Intelligent Environments

      <p>Recently, my ever-helpful labmate, <a title="Drew Stovall is thoroughly awesome" href="http://dstovall.com" target="_blank">Dr. Drew Stovall</a>, suggested the call for papers wiki, or <a title="Wiki Call for Papers (wikicfp)" href="http://www.wikicfp.com/cfp/home" target="_blank">wikicfp.com</a>. The site is well done: easy to navigate, intuitive, open, and free. Basically, you subscribe to the conferences you&rsquo;re interested in, then the site will email you approaching deadlines. They also offer an amazing calendar view so you can plan your <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">vacation</span> submissions.</p>

<p>As I prepare to propose and begin the sprint to the finish, I was reviewing target deadlines on the site. I noticed that a conference <a title="Andy Ko: Interview by Emerson Murphy-Hill" href="http://andyjko.com/2009/10/01/emerson-interview-part-2-writing-for-hci-venues/" target="_blank">recommended by one of my favorite researchers</a>, <a title="Dr. Andy Ko @ DUB" href="http://faculty.washington.edu/ajko/" target="_blank">Dr. Andy Ko</a> was not on the site. In about two minutes I was able to add the <a title="VL/HCC 2010" href="http://dei.inf.uc3m.es/vlhcc10/index.html" target="_blank"><em><span>IEEE Symposium on  Visual Languages and Human-Centric Computing 2010</span></em></a><span>,</span> not only to my own list, but to the site as a whole. N<span>ow, other HCI aficionados can sign stay abreast of the conference . See the CFP <a title="WikiCFP: VL/HCC 2010" href="http://www.wikicfp.com/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=6990" target="_blank">here</a>. There&rsquo;s probably a slant towards technical fields, which is to be expected because technical people are most likely to use a tool like this; however, the platform is incredibly powerful and open-ended, so I hope everyone uses the site.</span></p>

<p><span>I hope this is helpful for other paper-writers. </span><span>Are there other cool tools I&rsquo;m missing? I&rsquo;d love to find out how to do my job more efficiently, so please share!

      <p>Reading <em>ars technica</em> today, I saw an article entitled &ldquo;<a title="ARS Technica: New form of entanglement" href="http://arstechnica.com/science/news/2009/10/new-form-of-entanglement-plays-with-time-and-energy.ars" target="_blank">New form of entanglement plays with time and energy</a>.&rdquo; It sounded cool and important, from what I could understand. I skimmed the article, then I clicked on the <a title="Paper link" href="http://scitation.aip.org/getabs/servlet/GetabsServlet?prog=normal&amp;id=PRLTAO000103000016163601000001&amp;idtype=cvips&amp;gifs=yes" target="_blank">link to the paper in Physical Review Letters</a> and what did I find? The article was talking about work done by one of my oldest and dearest friends, Steve Sensarn. I&rsquo;m blown away by the caliber of Steve&rsquo;s work and the fact that a prominent site like <em>ars</em> would cover the research. Congratulations to Steve! Time to step my game up and do something magazine-worthy :)</p>

      <p>PETA is on campus this week, and as I was walking to lunch I saw a cute company van featuring an elephant painted across the visible surface. On the passenger side was the slogan, &ldquo;RINGLING BEATS ELEPHANTS.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.peta.org/archives/2007/06/hey_peta_pimp_m.php"><img title="PETA Van - Ringling and Elephants" src="http://blog.peta.org/archives/other%20side.JPG" alt="Ringling Beats Elephants - PETA van" width="448" height="336" /></a></p>

<p>My immediate reaction was, &ldquo;how else would you control a 5 ton beast?&rdquo; which is, of course, an insensitive joke; however, the reasoning stands. Elephants are too dangerous to roam freely around people. The much smaller, notoriously docile bovine don&rsquo;t even wander without restraints (fences, cages, leashes, etc.). Wild animals must be approached cautiously and humanely controlled.</p>

<p>So, with no more than three words and my own imagination I believe PETA&rsquo;s complaint is either excessive violence or the larger idea that elephants should not be caged at all. As I just said, a certain level of &ldquo;violence&rdquo; is necessary to protect circus patrons. I can understand people being upset  excess violence. I cannot understand the idea that elephants should not be caged because that implies they should never be transported out of the wild.</p>

<p>Thinking about it further, I&rsquo;m not sure I understand the controversy. I personally believe that elephants are wonderful, peaceful creatures. This opinion was formed, largely, by favorable depictions from the circus. My respect for the animal helps reinforce my distaste for ivory or anything that would harm the graceful giants. Ringling has helped many people appreciate pachyderms! I don&rsquo;t endorse beating elephants, but doesn&rsquo;t the circus create a net positive? Ringling Bros may hurt elephants in the short term, but they have helped elephants in the long term. Wouldn&rsquo;t the effort be better spent stopping people that are killing elephants (e.g., poachers)?</p>

<p>Do you agree? Am I missing something?</p>
