      <h1 class="link"><a href="/final-debate-obama-wins/">Final Debate: Obama Wins</a></h1>
      <p>The final presidential debate just concluded, and I believe Obama won.</p>

<p>Overall, Obama was more eloquent and presidential. He smiled politely and disagreed civilly. McCain brought up <a title="wikipedia bill ayers" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Ayers" target="_blank">Professor Ayers</a> but Obama did not reply with the <a title="wikipedia Keating 5" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keating_Five" target="_blank">Keating Five</a> or <a title="seth holloway's blog: troopergate" href="http://sethholloway.com/blog/?p=191" target="_blank">Troopergate</a>. While that was telling, my biggest beef with McCain tonight was based on an old adage: &lsquo;If you don&rsquo;t have your own ideas you attack others for theirs.&rsquo; McCain constantly picked on Obama&rsquo;s plans instead of explaining his old beliefs.</p>

<p>Both politicians realize that people are tired of the same-old same-old, but then they give us more of the same. If we really want to reform politics, I believe we need to get new ideas. The best way to do that is to embrace the multi party system. Real mavericks are independents, so it&rsquo;s no wonder that we have the same old Washington when there are only two choices.</p>

<p>In talking to people and watching political coverage, it seems that people hate the opposing candidate more than they like their own. How should that affect politics? How about voting For (+1) or Against (-1) on each candidate; the winner is the candidate with the highest score. Another idea is to simply offer each person a For (+1) or Against (-1) vote to use as they see fit. Those who hate Obama more than they like any other candidate could cancel their enemy out. There are a lot of ideas that could help promote democracy and break down partisanship.</p>

<p>Got any ideas? Did I miss something? Let me know!</p>

      <p>Friday, news of <a title="Wikipedia: Troopergate" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska_Public_Safety_Commissioner_dismissal" target="_blank">Troopergate</a> <a title="Troopergate investigation was stalled" href="http://www.independent.ie/world-news/americas/troopergate-inquiry-being-stalled-for-vote-1469839.html" target="_blank">finally</a> <a title="AP article on Troopergate" href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5jOTk11gvqDAgD0cY3i4WjI_2YOxwD93O5ESG0" target="_blank">broke</a>. This report concludes that Palin is guilty of the same lapses of judgment that let her get into office in Alaska. There is controversy because Palin is claiming that the report cleared her of wrong-doing when, in fact, it did not. The always-in-a-hurry Veep has not paused for photos much less a decent interview. Many people are <a title="Op-ed about Palin" href="http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/dn/opinion/editorials/stories/DN-trooper_14edi.State.Edition1.24f8dd2.html" target="_blank">disgusted by the governess</a> and <a title="Palin's husband under fire too" href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/washington/2008/10/sarah-palins-hu.html" target="_blank">her husband</a>.</p>

<p>Another mini scandal involves Palin&rsquo;s hometown. Wasila, Alaska removed building permits right before Palin had a nice home built. Who worked on the house? No one knows since there are no permits. Were the contractors paid, or did they work as a favor for the governess? No one knows since there are no permits.</p>

<p>And it gets worse still. At a rally she <a title="Whoops" href="http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/washington/AP-Palin.html" target="_blank">chastised supporters</a> when she thought they were mocking her. &lsquo;&#8217;I hope those protesters have the courage and honor to give veterans thanks for their right to protest!&ldquo; This was a mistake and everyone makes mistakes&mdash;we all know that. However, I have to wonder if she could keep it together when talking to politicians (foreign and domestic). Politicians should be passionate, but not childish.</p>

<p>Palin is quickly becoming a liability and a laughing-stock. Compounding the VP&rsquo;s problems are a weak presidential candidate. McCain&rsquo;s supporters are yelling radical statements at rallies and McCain has been less than impressive in recent weeks. The wheels are coming off the once mighty McCain campaign!</p>

<p>The time is right for a multi party system!</p>

      <p>Here&rsquo;s a bit of news I found absolutely amazing: <a title="WoW" href="http://www.ripten.com/2008/10/10/wow-whore-has-36-accounts-raids-by-himself/" target="_blank">a guy, Bradster, has 36 WoW </a>(World of Warcraft) accounts that he plays by himself! He plans to wreak havoc on enemy players in massive PvP battles. Here&rsquo;s his setup:
<img src="http://www.ripten.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/wow-36box2-1.jpg" alt="11 computers playing 36 WoW accounts" /></p>

<p>This phenomenon is known as <a title="Wikipedia Multiboxing" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-boxing" target="_blank">multiboxing</a>; I saw it in previous MMORPGs, but it has really taken off in <a title="WoWiki on Multiboxing" href="http://www.wowwiki.com/Multiboxing" target="_blank">WoW</a>. I have played as many as four accounts at once and I know someone who routinely plays five together, but 36 accounts is dedication!</p>

<p>As Bradster says, &lsquo;there are more expensive hobbies than WoW.&rsquo; Good luck in your struggles, Chummers.</p>

      <p>The World Wide Web is full of great deals! You can get all kinds of good stuff, if you know where to look. One popular scheme is to get a set amount of an item then sell it until it&rsquo;s gone; rinse and repeat. For example, <a href="http://www.woot.com" target="_blank">Woot</a> always runs one big deal. Woot also has subdomains for <a href="http://wine.woot.com" target="_blank">wine</a> and <a href="http://shirt.woot.com" target="_blank">shirts</a>. A similar idea, but for performance gear, <a href="http://www.steepandcheap.com/" target="_blank">Steep and Cheap</a> is great. I&rsquo;m watching for a small, waterproof messenger bag for under $40 (they&rsquo;re normally over $100). <a title="Slick Deals dot Net" href="http://slickdeals.net/" target="_blank">SlickDeals</a> aggregates different deals like a top-of-the-line Dell for $500! One last discount site I like is <a href="http://www.overstock.com" target="_blank">Overstock.com</a>. I got my simple wedding ring on Overstock for a very good price :)</p>

<p>But alas, I&rsquo;m a poor graduate student and these sites make me want to consumer whore so I must abstain.</p>

<p>If you know of other good deal sites, I&rsquo;m interested in hearing about them!</p>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/religulous-is-worth-watching/">Religulous is worth watching</a></h1>
      <p>Last night we watched <a title="Religulous" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0815241/" target="_blank">Religulous</a>, Bill Maher&rsquo;s documentary on religion. While not a cinematic masterpiece or textbook documentary, the movie is really funny and very entertaining. Maher is openly biased the whole time&mdash;he says openly that doubt is his product and no one really knows&mdash;but that did not take away from the experience for me.</p>

<p>The movie brilliantly splices in hilarious clips and displays what Maher is thinking during interviews.These additions are hardly necessary given the cast. Maher managed to find some of the most eccentric religious superheros alive today; for example he talks to a <a title="Jesus AND the Antichrist in one" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Luis_de_Jes%C3%BAs_Miranda" target="_blank">marketing genius</a> who claims to simultaneously be the second coming of Jesus and the Antichrist. (Sadly, the fellow has over 250,000 followers.) He visits the Netherlands where religious tolerance has caused a stir recently; while there Maher also meets a chap who believes in smoking pot (and that&rsquo;s about it) as well as some other interesting figures.</p>

<p>A few interesting points the movie made:</p>

<ul>
<li>16% of Americans claim no religious affiliation, but there is no lobby for these people</li>
<li>Religion is bigoted and unproven: If religion were a private club, it would be shut down or operate in the shadows</li>
<li>Religion has been used to kill millions of people throughout the ages</li>
<li>No one really knows</li>
</ul>


<p>Overall, it was really funny and concludes with a meaningful point.</p>

      <p>I&rsquo;ve been using Internet radio/social music for quite a while now; I didn&rsquo;t think much of it until I noticed a friend using iTunes&#8217; 30 second clips to sample new music. There&rsquo;s no need for that! There are plenty of websites that provide the entire song for free. How do they do it? Some aggregate the plethora of mp3s available online (try searching google for your favorite song + mp3 and you&rsquo;ll see what I mean); others pay royalties for all the songs they offer; others are magick. In any case, you can enjoy the rewards risk-free.</p>

<p>A few examples that offer music for free over the intarwebz are <a title="Last.fm" href="http://www.last.fm/" target="_blank">Last.fm</a> and <a title="Pandora" href="http://www.pandora.com/" target="_blank">Pandora</a>; these are great places to find new music because they&rsquo;ll play/suggest new music based on what you&rsquo;re listening to.</p>

<p>If you know what you want to hear, <a title="imeem" href="http://www.imeem.com/" target="_blank">imeem</a> and <a title="Seeqpod" href="http://www.seeqpod.com/" target="_blank">Seeqpod</a> allow you to create your own playlists. I&rsquo;ve had very good luck finding songs I want to hear (I&rsquo;ve found 90% of songs I search for). imeem even allows you to export the player similar to embedding YouTube videos; here&rsquo;s a sample of a random playlist:</p>

<object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="500" height="400" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="wmode" value="transparent" /><param name="src" value="http://media.imeem.com/pl/amfxhxhZgi/" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="500" height="400" src="http://media.imeem.com/pl/amfxhxhZgi/" wmode="transparent"></embed></object>


<p>Enjoy! And if you have other suggestions, I&rsquo;d love to hear them!</p>

      <p>As I mentioned earlier, <a title="Rock Band 2 is out -- SethHolloway.com" href="http://sethholloway.com/blog/?p=114" target="_blank">Rock Band 2 is out</a>. <a title="Guitar Hero Official Site" href="http://www.guitarhero.com/" target="_blank">Guitar Hero</a>: <a title="Guitar Hero World Tour" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar_Hero_IV" target="_blank">World Tour</a> (a.k.a. Guitar Hero IV) is not far behind. These games are doing extremely well, and I&rsquo;m not surprised. I have fond memories of playing the original <a title="Nintendo Power Pad" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_Pad" target="_blank">Power Pad</a> for Nintendo. I&rsquo;m glad to see a new generation of novel input devices for games because games have really stuck with standard controls for the last 15 years. Sure, there was a <a title="Duck Hunt Gun" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_hunt_gun" target="_blank">Zapper</a>, <a title="Power GLOVES!" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_glove" target="_blank">Power Glove</a>, <a title="Donkey Kong Bongos!" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donkey_Kong_Jungle_Beat" target="_blank">Donkey Kong Bongos</a>, and <a title="DDR" href="http://www.ddrfreak.com/aboutddr.php" target="_blank">DDR</a>, but games have not explored the space until recently. Think of the slew of games for the <a title="App Store" href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/appstore/" target="_blank">iPhone</a>, the Wii, and instrument-driven games&mdash;we&rsquo;ve only seen the tip of the iceberg! Beyond that, research into augmented reality (it&rsquo;s like virtual reality) has come a long way. This is an exciting time for gamers, indeed.</p>

<p>Beyond being a great time for gamers, it&rsquo;s a great time for developers! iPhone developers are doing well, the same could be possible for anyone related to music! There is a huge opportunity for instrument-driven games, but game makers and the RIAA <a title="Activision CEO wants more!" href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20081001/0245102424.shtml" target="_blank">can&rsquo;t determine how to divide the massive profits</a> (Rock band has <a title="21M downloaded songs" href="http://www.streetinsider.com/Press+Releases/MTV+Games,+Harmonix+and+Electronic+Arts+Ship+Rock+Band+2(TM)+for+XBOX+360(R)/3980528.html" target="_blank">over 21M song downloads</a>; Guitar Hero has <a title="10M songs downloaded" href="http://www.joystiq.com/2008/05/02/rock-band-ships-3-million-bundled-units-10-million-songs-down/" target="_blank">over 10M song downloads</a>).</p>

<p>Rock Band/Guitar Hero should take a page from Apple and publish a development kit. This development kit would allow people to put music into a format usable by instrument-driven games. Make it easy for people to create content and let them do the development for you! Hosting is cheap: set up a repository for musicians to submit their transcribed songs into and allow users to access the library; sell advertising, let musicians or the free market determine pricing; split profits.</p>

<p>These platforms are a great way to get your music known! There are opportunities for challenging songs, easy songs, fun party songs and more! Obscure and popular bands alike can profit. And fans would profit too. If the average person could grasp song structure and technical difficulty, it would educate the masses on music, allow more people into the creative process, raise the bar on musicians, and generally be awesome.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d also like to see new games being developed using the existing novel input devices. Now that we have gyros and guitars, innovate on the ways to use the tools. It can be done; <a title="Devil May Cry using Guitar Hero 3 controller" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CREs25IcHAU" target="_blank">check out</a> this kid playing Devil May Cry with the Guitar Hero axe.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s so much possibility! The time is right for novel input devices. Let&rsquo;s hope that content developers, hosting providers, and platform creators can agree on models that are good for the consumer.</p>

Now, I&rsquo;m trying to submit a claim to my vision insurance, <a title="Super Vision Homepage" href="http://www.superiorvision.com/" target="_blank">Superior Vision</a>. I am frustrated that the only claims options are fax or snail mail! I have no reason to believe that I will not receive my money, but I&rsquo;m frustrated at the lack of options at filing the claim.</p>

<p>Over the past several years I have been asked to fax a form. Everytime, I&rsquo;m left wondering who has a fax machine handy?</p>

<p>Furthermore, when will companies embrace the digital revolution? I&rsquo;ve scanned the receipt and my insurance card, but there&rsquo;s no email address that I can send it to. Using digital methods would save me, the consumer, and the company time and frustration.</p>

<p>Also, if fax machines are still being used widely, why is there not an open standard for email-to-fax machines?</p>
