      <h1 class="link"><a href="/a-few-thoughts-on-ruby/">A few thoughts on Ruby</a></h1>
      <p>This is not an exhaustive post, just a few thoughts in reaction to reading about and working with <a title="Ruby Lang Dot Org" href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a>.</p>

<p><a title="Wikipedia: Ruby" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_(programming_language)">Ruby</a>, a dynamic OO language, was developed by Yukihiro &ldquo;Matz&rdquo; Matsumoto in the mid &lsquo;90s. He wanted a powerful, unsurprising language. He borrowed from Perl, Smalltalk, and Lisp (even though <a title="Stege Yegge: Lisp is not an acceptable Lisp" href="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2006/04/lisp-is-not-acceptable-lisp.html">Lisp is not an acceptable Lisp</a>) while trying to focus on usability and following the <a title="Wikipedia: POLA" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment">principle of least astonishment (POLA)</a>.</p>

<p>Ruby saw it&rsquo;s popularity rise with Ruby on Rails (a popular web framework). Ruby is a really neat language: you can be high-level, you can use functional programming techniques, &hellip; all that good stuff. But enough of the history, here are my likes and dislikes in no particular order:</p>

<ul>
<li>It is really easy to change a variable&rsquo;s type. This is a general gripe with dynamic languages. I generally like the duck-typing, but you need to be disciplined with development practices&mdash;just because you can switch from a Fixnum to a String doesn&rsquo;t mean you should!</li>
<li>The lack of tail call optimization (TCO)! Just kidding. I borrowed this complaint from people smarter than myself.</li>
<li>I hate seeing &ldquo;TypeError: can&rsquo;t convert Fixnum into String!&#8221; I wish Ruby would cast to string automatically; objects have to_s, but you have to explicitly append to_s when outputting non-strings. Ruby knows you&rsquo;re trying to output something as a string and Ruby has a method to cast to a string, so why not do it for me? The better way to output variables is [&#8220;variable_name = #{variable_name}&rdquo;] but I find [&ldquo;variable_name = &rdquo; + variable_name] more clear.</li>
<li>I don&rsquo;t like returning the last statement in a function without a return keyword. You can write def sum(a,b) a+b; end and have a function that returns a+b. You can also write def sum(a,b) return a+b; end. I find the latter more clear. The problem gets worse when you have complex equations or ternary/inline if statements. Pros will probably understand this, but I have to think twice about what the method does: def foo(a,b) a&gt;0 ? a+b : a-b; end</li>
<li>Probably my biggest complaint is lack of explicit information, like parentheses. From the example above, you have parentheses in function definitions, but parentheses are not required for function calls; using our example above, foo a b is equivalent to foo(a, b). When you mix in symbols, default parameters, aliases, and several ways to do the same thing, programs can be very hard to follow. Digging through the Ruby on Rails source has left me scratching my head more than once.</li>
<li>I appreciate that introspection/reflection is made simple: just call Object.methods and you know the object&rsquo;s capabilities; call Object.class to find out its class.</li>
<li>I get tripped up by the handling of Nil, True, and False. Every object can be evaluated as a boolean, but things like empty strings, empty arrays and hashes, so you end up with lots of conditionals that check for nil or empty. The Rails helper method blank? is nice, but it does not work as expected with booleans. Also all integer values evaluate to true&mdash;even 0. As an Electrical/Computer Engineer I think computers have 1s and 0s&mdash;not trues and falses&mdash;and a 0 should map to false. A nil object is false, but not all false evaluations are caused by a nil; this can necessitate extra processing to determine why the program branched the way it did.</li>
<li>I love the range and capability of built-in functions! For example, you can turn any object into a string (Object.to_s). Need to generate permutations, just use <a title="Ruby: Array - Permutation" href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/core/classes/Array.html#M000287">Array.permutations</a>. Dealing with peoples&#8217; names? You can use <a title="Ruby: String - Capitalize" href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/core/classes/String.html#M001157">String.capitalize</a> to capitalize the first letter of each word in the string.</li>
<li>Sometimes I have to wonder &ldquo;who named the great built-in functions?&rdquo; Can the non-standard names be explained by the language creator being Japanese or are the names just strange for me? For example in <a title="Ruby: Array" href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/core/classes/Array.html">Array</a> there are several similar methods like flatten vs flatten! vs to_a vs to_ary, as well as to_s vs inspect. In <a title="Ruby: String" href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/core/classes/String.html">String</a> there&rsquo;s chomp, chop, strip, squeeze&hellip; which one trims? Sure, I&rsquo;ve learned now but it is not obvious in my opinion.</li>
<li>The Ruby convention is that &ldquo;dangerous&rdquo; methods are supposed to have an exclamation point, which can get confusing when exclamation points are also the NOT operator. The dangerous methods can act in place or return nil. The return bit breaks consistency because you have to selectively assign variables instead of using a standard pattern. @var = @string.strip! will make @var nil if your @string does not have whitespace (leaving @string unchanged) or it will make @var the stripped string, but @string is also changed. @var is properly assigned if you omit the exclamation point and just use @var = @string.strip.</li>
<li>Along the lines of the &ldquo;dangerous&rdquo; methods, methods that return a boolean should have a question mark like Object.nil?. Is the following line clear to you? @var.nil? ? @var.strip : @var.strip! A little trivia: the method! and method? is a convention borrowed from Scheme.</li>
<li>Operator precedence is tricky; for example, &amp;&amp; is equivalent to and, yet they have different precedence. Similar with or vs ||, not vs !</li>
<li>The community is great, but the divide between Ruby and Rails is sometimes too narrow. I recently tried to find a Ruby solution and the top hits were Rails-specific. This isn&rsquo;t bad if you&rsquo;re doing Rails development, and it may be beneficial if patches make it into the language and the framework. I&rsquo;ll be curious to see how this unfolds.</li>
</ul>


<p>That&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;ve got for now! Did I miss something?</p>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/my-latex-resume-template/">My LaTeX resume template</a></h1>
      <p>Several years ago I started writing my <a href="https://github.com/smholloway/resume/tree/master/latex">resume in LaTeX</a>. It was a great way to learn LaTeX and have fine-grained control over my resume. Overall, I&rsquo;m pleased with it, but I must admit that updating and recompiling the file can be a chore.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve had several people ask for my LaTeX resume template, so I figured I would share the wealth. You can find my custom resume file, mostly reduced to a template, in the <a href="https://github.com/smholloway/resume/tree/master/latex">latex folder of my resume repo on GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>To generate your resume, download and edit the .tex file, then compile (I use pdflatex on Mac, Windows, and Linux). Et voila! You have a nice looking PDF resume.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong> Here&rsquo;s my reply to the question from Yash.</p>

<div>I&#8217;m not sure I understand exactly what you want, but I would start by inserting a new contact section</div>


<div></div>


<div><span style="font-family: 'courier new', monospace;">\contact{Yash}{}{}{}</span></div>


<div></div>


<div></div>


<div>You could also create a new contact command, say a contact header. Compared to the standard contact command you remove the centering and trim it down to whatever number of arguments you want. Here&#8217;s an example for a left-aligned name.</div>


<div></div>


<div><span style="font-family: 'courier new', monospace;">\newcommand{\contactHeader}[1]{</span></div>


<div><span style="font-family: 'courier new', monospace;"> \begin{changemargin}{-0.5in}{-0.5in}</span></div>


<div><span style="font-family: 'courier new', monospace;">    {\Large \scshape {#1}}&#92; \smallskip</span></div>


<div><span style="font-family: 'courier new', monospace;"> \end{changemargin}</span></div>


<div>}</div>


<div></div>


<div></div>


<div>To control the spacing, consider forcing a newpage, then inserting the header like so</div>


<div></div>


<div><span style="font-family: 'courier new', monospace;">\newpage </span></div>


<div><span style="font-family: 'courier new', monospace;"> </span></div>


<div><span style="font-family: 'courier new', monospace;">\contactHeader{Yash}).</span></div>


<div></div>


<p>Beyond that, you&rsquo;re on your own! Tinker a bit and see what you come up with.</p>

      <p>Last year I started playing with Heroku, and I&rsquo;ve been very impressed so far. Heroku is a free (for basic service) Ruby on Rails hosting environment running in the cloud (Amazon EC2 in this case). Heroku is super simple to set up and use because you deploy with Git! The Git backing encourages version control and allows you to push bug fixes to your central repository as well as the productive server.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve played with other free hosting sites and services, blogs and social media, and cloud platforms like EC2 and Google App Engine&hellip; the Heroku workflow beats all of them. I can&rsquo;t think of an easier way to develop, test, and deploy! It seems that no one else can either: there are a lot of projects and posts about how to emulate this style in your own environment; there are also alternatives for node.js (like <a title="Joyent's node.js hosting environment" href="https://no.de/">Joyent&rsquo;s no.de service</a>), PHP (like <a title="PHP Fog" href="https://phpfog.com/">PHP Fog</a>), and word is that Heroku is working to allow all platforms. I look forward to a future where software development, setup, test, and deployment are easy and integrated in the process!</p>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/a-couple-quick-google-search-tricks/">A couple quick Google search tricks</a></h1>
      <p>I recently stumbled upon these tricks and thought others might find them interesting too; for example, I now know that I&rsquo;m the top hit for people searching for Seth Holloway in France.</p>

<p>To see results from a different location you can either</p>

<ul>
<li>go to the Google site you&rsquo;re interested in and append &ldquo;ncr&rdquo; to the URL (e.g., <a href="http://www.google.co.kr/ncr">http://www.google.co.kr/ncr</a> to see Korean search results) or</li>
<li>use the gl=&lt;two letter location&gt; parameter (e.g., <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=blah&amp;amp;gl=KR">http://www.google.com/search?q=blah&amp;amp;gl=KR</a>).</li>
</ul>


<p>To avoid personalization &ndash; add the <code>pws=0</code> flag</p>

<p>I found a nice example from an <a title="SEOmoz - how can I view google..." href="http://www.seomoz.org/q/how-can-i-view-google-com-serps-from-outside-the-us">SEOmoz article on how to retrieve results for a specific location without actually being in that location</a>:</p>

<blockquote>Use this as a model: http://www.google.com/search?q=your+search+query&amp;pws=0&amp;gl=US (obviously put your search query in where it says your+search+query (separated by plus signs)).

Broken down:

www.google.com - the search engine you want

pws=0 - remove any personalization

gl=US - return results as if you were in the US

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/the-merits-of-a-phd/">The merits of a PhD</a></h1>
      <p>I just found this buried at the bottom of my drafts&hellip; whoops! Soon I will post updated thoughts now that I&rsquo;ve completed the PhD&hellip;</p>

<blockquote>Whenever I tell people I am working on my PhD, I see two polarized opinions. One, my preferred response, is amazement. I do appreciate the approval.

The other response flows from people who do not believe a PhD is worthwhile. In terms of average income earned over a lifetime, the PhD is statistically out-earned by the MS. To this point I assert that correlation is not causation. In large companies and government organizations, PhDs are moving out of the labs and into management roles; among start-ups&#8211;a new idea in America&#8211;PhDs are more prevalent than in large organizations. Once the income earned from the new class of PhDs (those in management and those at start-ups) is fed into the equation, we may find that income is always proportional to level of education.

Another point that I&#8217;ve heard repeatedly attempts to diminish the PhD by pointing out the small-scale distribution of research. Yes, it is true that few people will ever read a PhD dissertation despite the fact that the dissertation is the culmination of thousands of hours of effort. However, to graduate a PhD candidate normally publishes a number of peer-reviewed papers that are read by others in the area; the candidate also has to defend his/her research to a group of eagle-eyed professors.

For me, the PhD is about self-fulfillment&#8211;the ability to stick with it and accomplish a difficult task. I&#8217;m not out for fortune or fame, and I hope that people I meet, whether they agree or disagree with the PhD, are equally realistic about their own life.</blockquote>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/responding-to-questions/">Responding to questions</a></h1>
      <p>Whenever someone asks you a question there are a range of responses, but in that universe of possibilities there are only three options:</p>

<ul>
<li>lie</li>
<li>tell the truth</li>
<li>refuse to answer</li>
</ul>


<p>In refusing to answer I see two approaches, the active and passive:</p>

<ul>
<li>active: something like &ldquo;that is too personal&rdquo; or &ldquo;none of your business&rdquo;</li>
<li>passive: play semantics</li>
</ul>


<p>Each method has its place. You can learn a lot about yourself and your peers if you observe when and why you (or others) apply these responses.</p>

<p>One of my favorite songs on the subject is <em>Policy of Truth</em> by Depeche Mode with some choice lyrics:</p>

<blockquote>Hide what you have to hide / And tell what you have to tell /
You&#8217;ll see your problems multiplied / If you continually decide / To faithfully pursue / The policy of truth</blockquote>

<p>People seem to equate rockstars with singers, but there are plenty of rock-stars that aren&rsquo;t the frontmen. Are you the steady bassist, grooving and keeping everyone on time? Are you the guitarist who steps in for a solo then falls back to some tasty licks? If you&rsquo;re not the lead singer, don&rsquo;t fret: you can be a rockstar in more than one way!</p>

      <p>I had my Google Adsense account banned. As you can see below, it is completely unclear why I might have been banned&hellip; was it related to my two previous hacks? was it a bored Chinese hacker clicking all my links? was it the Russian Business Network testing their click fraud ring on my site? was it that I had unusual traffic or unusual content or unusual amounts of clicks? I think it is because I randomly blogged about mesothelioma then had a day where I made $11 from ads (beating my previous best day by $11). The email titled &#8221;Google AdSense Account Disabled&#8221; only had this to say:</p>

Hello,

After reviewing our records, we&#8217;ve determined that your AdSense account
poses a risk of generating invalid activity. Because we have a
responsibility to protect our AdWords advertisers from inflated costs due
to invalid activity, we&#8217;ve found it necessary to disable your AdSense
account. Your outstanding balance and Google&#8217;s share of the revenue will
both be fully refunded back to the affected advertisers.

Please understand that we need to take such steps to maintain the
effectiveness of Google&#8217;s advertising system, particularly the
advertiser-publisher relationship. We understand the inconvenience that
this may cause you, and we thank you in advance for your understanding and
cooperation.

If you have any questions or concerns about the actions we&#8217;ve taken, how

Sincerely,

The Google AdSense Team</blockquote>


<p>I appealed the decision thinking (1) it is worth a shot, (2) I&rsquo;m a small fish, and (3) the terms of service state that clicking your own ads yields invalid clicks, which led me to believe clicks from the owners account were filtered. Apparently, instead of filtering your clicks, they ban you.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the automated message from my appeal.</p>

<blockquote>Hello,

Thank you for your appeal. We appreciate the additional information you&#8217;ve
provided, as well as your continued interest in the AdSense program.
However, after thoroughly re-reviewing your account data and taking your
feedback into consideration, our specialists have confirmed that we&#8217;re
unable to reinstate your AdSense account.

<p>I&rsquo;m left wondering &ldquo;What if you see an interesting ad on your own page?&rdquo; &ldquo;How motivated is Google to find click fraud when ads account for almost all of their revenue?&rdquo; &ldquo;What percentage of the population is Google willing to ban?&rdquo; Along those lines, Google Will Eat Itself (<a title="Google Will Eat Itself" href="http://gwei.org/index.php"><a href="http://gwei.org/index.php">http://gwei.org/index.php</a></a>) is a performance art group that has a click fraud ring going. The proceeds of this duplicitous venture are being plowed into Google stock. In a mere 200,000 years the group can own all of Google.</p>

<p>This was a painful lesson to learn. I messed up. In my opinion, the terms of service should be more clear and Google should either speak bluntly about black hat and bannable offenses, or not assume that offenders are black hatters worthy of a ban. Also, the minimalistic feature robot that is Google should offer more explanation for why accounts were banned and at least give the impression that a human is involved in the process&mdash;it is hard to bond with a cold, automated company.</p>

<p>In defense of Google, they offer a great, easy-to-use service with competitive payouts. (It is shocking that no other advertising company has caught on.) I do wish they were more lenient on first offenses from nobodies. Live and learn!</p>

      <p>If you asked me today, I&rsquo;d say I am in favor of certifications and accreditation. If a professional organization offered a worthwhile broad certification, software may be a very different beast. I have seen the power of certifications through my friends in accounting and actuarial sciences; both professions are bolstered by their professional certification. I posit that software can be written by anyone, but maybe it shouldn&rsquo;t be; with the proper certification we could increase code quality, security, safety, and base knowledge.</p>

<p>One could point out that software development currently has certifications such as those offered by Microsoft and Cisco, as well as a number of lesser-known bodies offering certifications in software testing and other areas. I find these certifications to be flimsy and unnecessarily specific&mdash;very different than the meaningful equivalent certification offered by a state&rsquo;s bar exam (for lawyers).</p>

<p>Beyond ensuring a base set of knowledge, we could keep jobs that are being offshored and outsourced. How? The government requires that any company receiving federal money has to employ certified U.S. software developers. Now companies have a choice: cheap labor or government money. Certifications give funding bodies and customers one more knob to turn when deciding how much money to give or who to hire.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve seen certification debated by some people who talk about how it would not work if imposed today. That&rsquo;s true, but looking years into the future there could be a robust industry built on the backs of people willing to jump through hoops in order to focus on their craft. Today, a high school kid could be a lawyer, except for the bar exam; the same prodigious youth could be a doctor, except for the certification. Uncertified people may even be better than their educated counterparts, but judging by who we go to for legal advice and medical help, few people care to take a chance on those unwilling or unable to take the tests. Our society is built on signaling mechanisms that reward dedication to a craft; software certifications would be no different.</p>

<p>Googling for the benefits of professional certifications I came across a number of interesting studies and opinions. Argument from authority was common as people state how certifications exist for law, medicine, accounting, personal training, social work, education, and more; this makes certifications popular, not right. Determining what certification exams is a really hard problem, and centralizing the power stands to create corruption and slow the industry. Certification also works to unionize professionals and redistribute wealth. From a laziness standpoint, certifications layer on a lot of work and responsibility.</p>

<p>So, given the advantages and disadvantages, are certifications in software good, bad, or just plain ugly?</p>

      <p>I&rsquo;m learning a ton this summer as I relearn old tricks and learn new tricks. Among other technologies, frameworks, languages, and techniques, I&rsquo;m improving my Java skills. A friend recommended <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0321356683/?tag=theven01-20">Joshua Block&rsquo;s Effective Java Version 2</a>. The introduction succinctly states that the book aims to improve your usage of Java&mdash;something not usually taught in classes or discussed in book. Here are a few things I (re)learned:</p>

<ul>
<li>Local variables should be instantiated; if you cannot assign a sane default value, you shouldn&rsquo;t be assigning the variable yet.</li>
<li>Variables should be located near their use. In the C style you would declare all variables at the top of the method; however, this is not the best practice in modern Java. (Does anyone know if the &lsquo;variables at top&rsquo; still reigns in C?)</li>
<li>while loops should be used only if you need the local index variable outside the loop</li>
<li>For-each loops should be used whenever possible</li>
<li><p>The next best loop is a for loop with the end condition assigned in the loop (a technique I believe we could weakly call <a title="Wikipedia: memoization" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization">memoization</a> because we only have to calculate something once), for example:</p>

<p> for (int i = 0, len = myDataStructure.calculateSomething(); i &lt; len; i++) {
     // do something
 }</p></li>
</ul>
