      <p>I just found this buried at the bottom of my drafts&hellip; whoops! Soon I will post updated thoughts now that I&rsquo;ve completed the PhD&hellip;</p>

<blockquote>Whenever I tell people I am working on my PhD, I see two polarized opinions. One, my preferred response, is amazement. I do appreciate the approval.

The other response flows from people who do not believe a PhD is worthwhile. In terms of average income earned over a lifetime, the PhD is statistically out-earned by the MS. To this point I assert that correlation is not causation. In large companies and government organizations, PhDs are moving out of the labs and into management roles; among start-ups&#8211;a new idea in America&#8211;PhDs are more prevalent than in large organizations. Once the income earned from the new class of PhDs (those in management and those at start-ups) is fed into the equation, we may find that income is always proportional to level of education.

Another point that I&#8217;ve heard repeatedly attempts to diminish the PhD by pointing out the small-scale distribution of research. Yes, it is true that few people will ever read a PhD dissertation despite the fact that the dissertation is the culmination of thousands of hours of effort. However, to graduate a PhD candidate normally publishes a number of peer-reviewed papers that are read by others in the area; the candidate also has to defend his/her research to a group of eagle-eyed professors.

For me, the PhD is about self-fulfillment&#8211;the ability to stick with it and accomplish a difficult task. I&#8217;m not out for fortune or fame, and I hope that people I meet, whether they agree or disagree with the PhD, are equally realistic about their own life.</blockquote>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/responding-to-questions/">Responding to questions</a></h1>
      <p>Whenever someone asks you a question there are a range of responses, but in that universe of possibilities there are only three options:</p>

<ul>
<li>lie</li>
<li>tell the truth</li>
<li>refuse to answer</li>
</ul>


<p>In refusing to answer I see two approaches, the active and passive:</p>

<ul>
<li>active: something like &ldquo;that is too personal&rdquo; or &ldquo;none of your business&rdquo;</li>
<li>passive: play semantics</li>
</ul>


<p>Each method has its place. You can learn a lot about yourself and your peers if you observe when and why you (or others) apply these responses.</p>

<p>One of my favorite songs on the subject is <em>Policy of Truth</em> by Depeche Mode with some choice lyrics:</p>

<blockquote>Hide what you have to hide / And tell what you have to tell /
You&#8217;ll see your problems multiplied / If you continually decide / To faithfully pursue / The policy of truth</blockquote>

      <p>There&rsquo;s an idea of rockstar developers&mdash;lots of companies are looking for them (evidenced by <a title="Google: Rock star developer" href="http://www.google.com/search?q=rock-star+developer">this search</a>).  If you don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m talking about, see these related posts: <a title="Google: rockstar developer" href="http://www.google.com/search?q=rock-star+developer">Google: rockstar developer</a>, <a title="Top 10 traits of a rockstar software engineer" href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/top_10_software_engineer_traits.php">Top 10 Traits of a Rockstar Software Engineer</a>, <a title="You don't really want a rockstar" href="http://www.pseudocoder.com/blog/you-dont-really-want-a-rock-star">You Don&rsquo;t Really Want a Rock Star</a>, <a title="The case against rock star developers" href="http://www.stephenforte.net/PermaLink,guid,c0bdc70a-8e84-4339-ab44-4f4fefed8617.aspx">The case against Rock Star developers</a>.</p>

<p>People seem to equate rockstars with singers, but there are plenty of rock-stars that aren&rsquo;t the frontmen. Are you the steady bassist, grooving and keeping everyone on time? Are you the guitarist who steps in for a solo then falls back to some tasty licks? If you&rsquo;re not the lead singer, don&rsquo;t fret: you can be a rockstar in more than one way!</p>

      <p>I had my Google Adsense account banned. As you can see below, it is completely unclear why I might have been banned&hellip; was it related to my two previous hacks? was it a bored Chinese hacker clicking all my links? was it the Russian Business Network testing their click fraud ring on my site? was it that I had unusual traffic or unusual content or unusual amounts of clicks? I think it is because I randomly blogged about mesothelioma then had a day where I made $11 from ads (beating my previous best day by $11). The email titled &#8221;Google AdSense Account Disabled&#8221; only had this to say:</p>

Hello,

After reviewing our records, we&#8217;ve determined that your AdSense account
poses a risk of generating invalid activity. Because we have a
responsibility to protect our AdWords advertisers from inflated costs due
to invalid activity, we&#8217;ve found it necessary to disable your AdSense
account. Your outstanding balance and Google&#8217;s share of the revenue will
both be fully refunded back to the affected advertisers.

Please understand that we need to take such steps to maintain the
effectiveness of Google&#8217;s advertising system, particularly the
advertiser-publisher relationship. We understand the inconvenience that
this may cause you, and we thank you in advance for your understanding and
cooperation.

If you have any questions or concerns about the actions we&#8217;ve taken, how
you can appeal this decision, or invalid activity in general, you can find
more information by visiting

Sincerely,

The Google AdSense Team</blockquote>


<p>I appealed the decision thinking (1) it is worth a shot, (2) I&rsquo;m a small fish, and (3) the terms of service state that clicking your own ads yields invalid clicks, which led me to believe clicks from the owners account were filtered. Apparently, instead of filtering your clicks, they ban you.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the automated message from my appeal.</p>

<blockquote>Hello,

Thank you for your appeal. We appreciate the additional information you&#8217;ve
provided, as well as your continued interest in the AdSense program.
However, after thoroughly re-reviewing your account data and taking your
feedback into consideration, our specialists have confirmed that we&#8217;re
unable to reinstate your AdSense account.

As a reminder, if you have any questions or concerns about your account,

<p>I&rsquo;m left wondering &ldquo;What if you see an interesting ad on your own page?&rdquo; &ldquo;How motivated is Google to find click fraud when ads account for almost all of their revenue?&rdquo; &ldquo;What percentage of the population is Google willing to ban?&rdquo; Along those lines, Google Will Eat Itself (<a title="Google Will Eat Itself" href="http://gwei.org/index.php"><a href="http://gwei.org/index.php">http://gwei.org/index.php</a></a>) is a performance art group that has a click fraud ring going. The proceeds of this duplicitous venture are being plowed into Google stock. In a mere 200,000 years the group can own all of Google.</p>

<p>This was a painful lesson to learn. I messed up. In my opinion, the terms of service should be more clear and Google should either speak bluntly about black hat and bannable offenses, or not assume that offenders are black hatters worthy of a ban. Also, the minimalistic feature robot that is Google should offer more explanation for why accounts were banned and at least give the impression that a human is involved in the process&mdash;it is hard to bond with a cold, automated company.</p>

<p>In defense of Google, they offer a great, easy-to-use service with competitive payouts. (It is shocking that no other advertising company has caught on.) I do wish they were more lenient on first offenses from nobodies. Live and learn!</p>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/software-certifications-good-bad-ugly/">Software certifications: good, bad, or ugly?</a></h1>
      <p>If you asked me today, I&rsquo;d say I am in favor of certifications and accreditation. If a professional organization offered a worthwhile broad certification, software may be a very different beast. I have seen the power of certifications through my friends in accounting and actuarial sciences; both professions are bolstered by their professional certification. I posit that software can be written by anyone, but maybe it shouldn&rsquo;t be; with the proper certification we could increase code quality, security, safety, and base knowledge.</p>

<p>One could point out that software development currently has certifications such as those offered by Microsoft and Cisco, as well as a number of lesser-known bodies offering certifications in software testing and other areas. I find these certifications to be flimsy and unnecessarily specific&mdash;very different than the meaningful equivalent certification offered by a state&rsquo;s bar exam (for lawyers).</p>

<p>Beyond ensuring a base set of knowledge, we could keep jobs that are being offshored and outsourced. How? The government requires that any company receiving federal money has to employ certified U.S. software developers. Now companies have a choice: cheap labor or government money. Certifications give funding bodies and customers one more knob to turn when deciding how much money to give or who to hire.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve seen certification debated by some people who talk about how it would not work if imposed today. That&rsquo;s true, but looking years into the future there could be a robust industry built on the backs of people willing to jump through hoops in order to focus on their craft. Today, a high school kid could be a lawyer, except for the bar exam; the same prodigious youth could be a doctor, except for the certification. Uncertified people may even be better than their educated counterparts, but judging by who we go to for legal advice and medical help, few people care to take a chance on those unwilling or unable to take the tests. Our society is built on signaling mechanisms that reward dedication to a craft; software certifications would be no different.</p>

<p>Googling for the benefits of professional certifications I came across a number of interesting studies and opinions. Argument from authority was common as people state how certifications exist for law, medicine, accounting, personal training, social work, education, and more; this makes certifications popular, not right. Determining what certification exams is a really hard problem, and centralizing the power stands to create corruption and slow the industry. Certification also works to unionize professionals and redistribute wealth. From a laziness standpoint, certifications layer on a lot of work and responsibility.</p>

<p>So, given the advantages and disadvantages, are certifications in software good, bad, or just plain ugly?</p>

      <p>I&rsquo;m learning a ton this summer as I relearn old tricks and learn new tricks. Among other technologies, frameworks, languages, and techniques, I&rsquo;m improving my Java skills. A friend recommended <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0321356683/?tag=theven01-20">Joshua Block&rsquo;s Effective Java Version 2</a>. The introduction succinctly states that the book aims to improve your usage of Java&mdash;something not usually taught in classes or discussed in book. Here are a few things I (re)learned:</p>

<ul>
<li>Local variables should be instantiated; if you cannot assign a sane default value, you shouldn&rsquo;t be assigning the variable yet.</li>
<li>Variables should be located near their use. In the C style you would declare all variables at the top of the method; however, this is not the best practice in modern Java. (Does anyone know if the &lsquo;variables at top&rsquo; still reigns in C?)</li>
<li>while loops should be used only if you need the local index variable outside the loop</li>
<li>For-each loops should be used whenever possible</li>
<li><p>The next best loop is a for loop with the end condition assigned in the loop (a technique I believe we could weakly call <a title="Wikipedia: memoization" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization">memoization</a> because we only have to calculate something once), for example:</p>

<p> for (int i = 0, len = myDataStructure.calculateSomething(); i &lt; len; i++) {
     // do something
 }</p></li>

<p>For the second: Junior, J.R., June, Chip, Duece, Two, Bud, &lt;First name initial&gt;.J. (e.g., Seth Jr. would be S.J.), Little &lt;Name&gt; (e.g., Little Seth), Younger &lt;Name&gt; (e.g., Younger Seth), Skip (particularly if the name skipped a generation), Sonny</p>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/scripting-heroku-backups/">Scripting Heroku backups</a></h1>
      <p>I was looking for a way to backup applications on Heroku and found a few options. There&rsquo;s a Rails plugin that stores your backups on Amazon S3 (<a title="Heroku S3 Backup plugin" href="https://github.com/edavis10/heroku_s3_backup"><a href="https://github.com/edavis10/heroku_s3_backup">https://github.com/edavis10/heroku_s3_backup</a></a>), but I am satisfied with local backups.</p>

<p>So I updated an existing solution (<a title="Ben Scheirman's blog" href="http://flux88.com/2010/02/scripting-heroku-backups/"><a href="http://flux88.com/2010/02/scripting-heroku-backups/">http://flux88.com/2010/02/scripting-heroku-backups/</a></a>) based on Heroku&rsquo;s updated documentation (<a title="Heroku Docs: pgbackups" href="http://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/pgbackups"><a href="http://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/pgbackups">http://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/pgbackups</a></a>).</p>

<pre># lib/tasks/backup.rake

# Create a backup of a Rails application deployed to Heroku
# Technique taken from Ben Scheirman - http://flux88.com/2010/02/scripting-heroku-backups/
# Place file in lib/tasks/backup.rake (replace your_app_name with your application's Heroku name)
# Invoke using rake your_app_name:backup
# Dependencies: the heroku gem, the pgbackups heroku addon
namespace :your_app_name do
    desc 'Captures a heroku backup. Ensure you have the heroku gem and pgbackups addon installed\n
                gem install heroku &amp;&amp; heroku addons:add pgbackups'

    task :backup do
        # capture the backup bundle
        timestamp = `date -u '+%Y-%m-%d-%H-%M'`.chomp
        bundle_name = "your_app_name-#{timestamp}"
        puts "Capturing bundle #{bundle_name}..."
        `heroku pgbackups:capture --app your_app_name '#{bundle_name}'`

        # download &amp; destroy the bundle we just captured
        puts "Downloading bundle #{bundle_name}.dump"
        backup_url = `heroku pgbackups:url`
        `curl -o '#{bundle_name}'.dump '#{backup_url}'`

        # move the backup
        puts "Moving bundle to backups/#{bundle_name}.dump"
        `mkdir backups/`
        `mv '#{bundle_name}'.dump backups/#{bundle_name}.dump`
    end
end</pre>


<p>I&rsquo;ve also uploaded the file to my github account: <a title="Seth Holloway's GitHub" href="https://github.com/smholloway/miscellaneous/blob/master/rails/backup.rake"><a href="https://github.com/smholloway/miscellaneous/blob/master/rails/backup.rake">https://github.com/smholloway/miscellaneous/blob/master/rails/backup.rake</a></a></p>

<p>There are a lot of things you could do to extend this further; for example, you could create a cron job to run the task periodically or schedule a few minutes every week to make the backups.</p>

<p>Let me know if you can improve this or if you find it useful.</p>

      <p>I&rsquo;ve become fascinated with the way that people signal they are selling their vehicles. Virtually everytime I drive somewhere, I see a car that is for sale by owner.</p>

<p>Here are a few styles I&rsquo;ve seen:</p>

<blockquote>$555-5555

This ambiguous note seems to say &#8220;for sale&#8221; by using a dollar sign ($) butted up against a phone number. The &#8220;for sale&#8221; and telephone number are not clear, so maybe that&#8217;s just the price range.</blockquote>




<blockquote>4-sale 555-555-5555

I like this one. If I saw this car while on a road trip, I&#8217;d know it was available and how to contact the seller.</blockquote>




<blockquote>sale 555-555-5555

Not bad, but are they selling their phone number? The note could be more clearly written.</blockquote>




<p><blockquote>180k $800 5555555</p>

<p>Without more context, I have to interpret this myself. I assume it means the seller wants $800 for their 180,000 mile car and they can be reached at 5555555 (or was that 555555 or 55555555?).</p>

<p><blockquote> $1000 OBO</p>

<p>Here, &ldquo;OBO&rdquo; means &ldquo;or best offer&rdquo; showing that the seller is negotiable on price. I tend to think most prices are negotiable, particularly when dealing with individuals, however, the &ldquo;OBO&rdquo; conveys a great willingness to work with the seller (probably a good thing). Should I just flag down the owner and negotiate while driving?</blockquote></p>

<p>The personal car advertisement brings up questions of usability and efficiency in generating sales. What&rsquo;s most effective? What information is necessary? I don&rsquo;t know, but here are a few thoughts:</p>

<ul>
<li>The only constant among the advertisements seems to be a phone number. I think this makes sense, since the buyer needs a way to contact the seller and make the transaction.</li>
<li>In general, I think it&rsquo;s short sighted to put only a 7 digit phone number. Cars, and the people contained within, are mobile. It&rsquo;s not unreasonable to think that you may leave your area code or have others enter yours.</li>
<li>Putting too much information feels counter-productive.</li>
<li>Numbers like price or number of miles are very hard to differentiate from phone number</li>
<li>It is very difficult to assess the vehicle and write down the phone number while driving, so stationary vehicles are probably more effective.</li>
</ul>


<p>I would recommend a clearly written advertisement on the back windshield that states the intention to sell (&ldquo;for sale&rdquo;) and a contact phone number (10 digits, appropriately separated with dashes). In conjunction, list your car on craigslists, ebay motors, zip zoom auto, and tell your friends verbally and over facebook. And one high-tech idea: put a QR code on a sheet of paper in the window. Boom!</p>

      <p>This post is a few weeks overdue. On May 20, I officially completed my PhD from The University of Texas at Austin, making me Seth Holloway, PhD. Pretty neat, huh? I have more to say about my work, academia, working while going to school, but it&rsquo;ll have to wait. For now, just a teaser :)</p>

<p>Note: The title is just a joke: I still respond to Seth. I&rsquo;m looking for more ways to incorporate the Dr. or PhD (or more correctly, Ph.D.), and there really aren&rsquo;t many. At least I&rsquo;ll have this blog post.</p>
