      <p>I&rsquo;m looking for the best way to determine a statistical model. I have a lot of data that comprises some (not all) variables and the associated outputs. Now, I would like to solve for the weights for the variables.</p>

<p>In the past I used Excel as well as a now defunct super spreadsheet application.  <a title="Weka from the University of Waikato" href="http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/">Weka</a> was recommended, but I&rsquo;m curious what other options exist. Is there a software package that will run different regressions, ultimately provided the best fit model?</p>

<p>Any help will be appreciated!</p>

      <p>Since graduating I&rsquo;ve had an awesome time building things. I have learned a ton, and I&rsquo;m excited to continue learning! You can find a sample of my recent work at <a href="http://pairstream.com/">PairSTREAM</a>. Note: These are mostly proofs of concept or app in indefinite beta. The site highlights a number of apps:</p>

<ul>
<li><a title="PairSTREAM - Marry Murder Mate" href="http://pairstream.com/random-game.php">Marry Murder Mate</a> - the party game (also known as Fuck Marry Kill, Screw Marry Kill, &hellip;) applied to your Facebook friends</li>

<p>These apps use a variety of technologies including Java, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Python, Google (App Engine), Facebook (apps and ads), Twitter (apps), Heroku, jQuery, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, MySQL, git, SVN&hellip;</p>

<p>Beyond the above apps, I have played with browser extensions (Chrome and Firefox), blogging (Wordpress, Tumblr, Posterous, Blogger), Amazon (Web Services and Affiliate program), Google (search, AdWords, AdSense, Web Elements), Microsoft (BizSpark), iOS, Fog Creek (for Student and Startups - Kiln, FogBugz), node.js (including Joyent&rsquo;s SmartMachine). I&rsquo;ve read about many more, but haven&rsquo;t had a chance to implement anything yet. I&rsquo;m working to improve my business accumen, marketing abilities, and design skills. So much to do, so little time! But life is good :)</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m working on some other fun stuff now, but I&rsquo;ll save that for another post.</p>

      <p>Back in the day I used <a title="Firefox addon: Greasemonkey" href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/">Greasemonkey</a> and <a title="Firefox addon: Stylish" href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/stylish/">Stylish</a> for Firefox&ndash;even contributing something to <a title="Userscripts dot org" href="http://www.userscripts.org">userscripts.org</a> (a huge repository of GreaseMonkey and Stylish scripts). Chrome is currently my browser of choice, and I thought of how nice it would be to tweak sites using a little homegrown JavaScript. Turns out, Chrome has Greasemonkey&rsquo;s user script capability built-in.</p>

<p>Any file named &lt;whatever&gt;.user.js will be interpreted as a user script. Simply open the file in Chrome and install it. Now you have a dead simple Chrome extension! As you can see below, there are a couple steps in the install process:</p>

<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-1373" title="user script install step 1" src="/images/userscript-install-1.png" alt="user script install step 1" /></p>

<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-1374" title="user script install step 2" src="/images/userscript-install-2.png" alt="user script install step 2" /></p>

<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-1375" title="user script install step 3" src="/images/userscript-install-3.png" alt="user script install step 3" /></p>

<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-1376" title="user script install step 4" src="/images/userscript-install-4.png" alt="user script install step 4" /></p>

<p>I created an example user script for Chrome that hides the black bar now appearing that the top of Google sites. I chose Google Reader specifically to demonstrate the @include and @exclude options. You can find it here:  <a href="https://github.com/smholloway/miscellaneous/blob/master/javascript/simple.user.js" title="Seth Holloway's GitHub: simple user script"><a href="https://github.com/smholloway/miscellaneous/blob/master/javascript/simple.user.js">https://github.com/smholloway/miscellaneous/blob/master/javascript/simple.user.js</a></a></p>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/we-need-an-integrated-front-back-web-programming-language/">We need an integrated front-back web programming language</a></h1>
      <p>Modern web programming requires a lot of knowledge&ndash;too much, I&rsquo;d say. To write a complete web application you need to work with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, a programming language (PHP, Python, Ruby, Java, etc), and a database. Even if you&rsquo;re a head-down back-end programmer, you should know about the structure and style of the front-end; as a front-end designer, you would do well to understand the framework and database.</p>

<p>There has been a huge explosion of web frameworks radically lowering the barrier to entry for any and all programmers. So, you know C++ and there&rsquo;s a C++ web framework, but you&rsquo;ll still need to know HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on the front-end and a database on the back-end. Node.js is potentially interesting for many reasons, but perhaps the most exciting thing is that you can program the front- and back-end using JavaScript. Better than having to learn JavaScript and a back-end language, but you will still need to know a database, HTML, and CSS.</p>

<p>As I see it, the shortest path would be a high-level programming language with an ORM (object relational mapper) that integrates template builders (something like mokk.me or Dreamweaver). The ORM abstracts out database specifics and allows the programmer to work with a more familiar construct, objects, while providing necessary methods like save, edit and delete. A template builder would visually handle HTML/CSS so that it feels more like design than development. Allowing components to be optimized later (replace or tweak the ORM with better SQL calls) would make the language/framework even better.</p>

<p>An alternative approach is an open source Flash-type language, that benefits from a standard plugin container. Sadly, in over 20 years of the web, the most integrated solution we have is Adobe Flash&ndash;a much maligned (insecure, bloated, slow, proprietary, &hellip;) language. For all its faults, Flash allowed people to create dynamic web pages that rendered uniformly&ndash;as designed&ndash;across browsers. Opening the spec may help as open specs are generally more secure and more optimized than closed versions. If the spec was open, people could write converters from various languages allowing everyone to produce the same output.</p>

<p>While we research an integrated web language there&rsquo;s also room for people to research a new application container. The web browser replacement could use the same stack (TCP/IP, HTTP and HTML) or define new protocols.</p>

<p>Did I miss an option? What do you think will win?</p>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/highlighting-the-current-page-link-in-a-navigation-bar-template/">Highlighting the current page link in a navigation bar template</a></h1>
      <p>I have not seen anything about how to properly highlight what page you&rsquo;re currently on when using a templated navigation bar on a dynamic webpage&hellip; I couldn&rsquo;t even google for a solution because I don&rsquo;t know the correct terminology.</p>

<p>There are a number of ways to highlight the link to the page you&rsquo;re currently on. For example, you could pass a parameter and alter the view based on the parameter; or you could include the navigation pane in each content view then apply the highlight with the page. I don&rsquo;t think either of those solutions is very clean, so here&rsquo;s my solution using HTML, CSS, and jQuery (it should work across browsers).</p>

<pre>&lt;!-- index.html --&gt;</pre>


<pre>&lt;div id="topnav"&gt;</pre>


<pre>   &lt;ul&gt;</pre>


<pre>       &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="home"&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</pre>


<pre>       &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="about"&gt;About&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</pre>


<pre>       &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="links"&gt;Links&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</pre>


<pre>       &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="services"&gt;Services&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</pre>


<pre>       &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="contact"&gt;Contact&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</pre>


<pre>   &lt;/ul&gt;</pre>


<pre>&lt;/div&gt;</pre>


<p>The unordered list is styled as a standard navigation menu (A List Apart has a nice article and book about it), and I have it setup to highlight whatever menu item is hovered. To highlight the current page, I set that item to the same background color as the hover effect. A little snippet here:</p>

<pre>/* application.css */</pre>


<pre>a:hover, a:focus { background: #454d2f; }</pre>


<pre>.highlight { background: #454d2f; }</pre>


<p>Now, all that&rsquo;s left is to let jQuery apply the highlight class to the menu item corresponding to the page we&rsquo;re on; an effect I achieve thusly:</p>

<pre>// application.js</pre>


<pre>$('#topnav').ready(function() {
    var page = window.location.href.split("/")[3]; // after the slash at the end of the domain name 
    if (page == "") { page = "home"; }
    $(this).find("a[href$="+page+"]").addClass("highlight"); 
});</pre>


<p>You could do this without jQuery, but it is my favorite JavaScript library and I like to use it :)</p>

<p>Does anyone know of a better way?</p>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/a-few-thoughts-on-ruby/">A few thoughts on Ruby</a></h1>
      <p>This is not an exhaustive post, just a few thoughts in reaction to reading about and working with <a title="Ruby Lang Dot Org" href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a>.</p>

<p><a title="Wikipedia: Ruby" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_(programming_language)">Ruby</a>, a dynamic OO language, was developed by Yukihiro &ldquo;Matz&rdquo; Matsumoto in the mid &lsquo;90s. He wanted a powerful, unsurprising language. He borrowed from Perl, Smalltalk, and Lisp (even though <a title="Stege Yegge: Lisp is not an acceptable Lisp" href="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2006/04/lisp-is-not-acceptable-lisp.html">Lisp is not an acceptable Lisp</a>) while trying to focus on usability and following the <a title="Wikipedia: POLA" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment">principle of least astonishment (POLA)</a>.</p>

<p>Ruby saw it&rsquo;s popularity rise with Ruby on Rails (a popular web framework). Ruby is a really neat language: you can be high-level, you can use functional programming techniques, &hellip; all that good stuff. But enough of the history, here are my likes and dislikes in no particular order:</p>

<ul>
<li>It is really easy to change a variable&rsquo;s type. This is a general gripe with dynamic languages. I generally like the duck-typing, but you need to be disciplined with development practices&ndash;just because you can switch from a Fixnum to a String doesn&rsquo;t mean you should!</li>
<li>The lack of tail call optimization (TCO)! Just kidding. I borrowed this complaint from people smarter than myself.</li>
<li>I hate seeing &ldquo;TypeError: can&rsquo;t convert Fixnum into String!&#8221; I wish Ruby would cast to string automatically; objects have to_s, but you have to explicitly append to_s when outputting non-strings. Ruby knows you&rsquo;re trying to output something as a string and Ruby has a method to cast to a string, so why not do it for me? The better way to output variables is [&#8220;variable_name = #{variable_name}&rdquo;] but I find [&ldquo;variable_name = &rdquo; + variable_name] more clear.</li>
<li>I don&rsquo;t like returning the last statement in a function without a return keyword. You can write def sum(a,b) a+b; end and have a function that returns a+b. You can also write def sum(a,b) return a+b; end. I find the latter more clear. The problem gets worse when you have complex equations or ternary/inline if statements. Pros will probably understand this, but I have to think twice about what the method does: def foo(a,b) a&gt;0 ? a+b : a-b; end</li>
<li>Probably my biggest complaint is lack of explicit information, like parentheses. From the example above, you have parentheses in function definitions, but parentheses are not required for function calls; using our example above, foo a b is equivalent to foo(a, b). When you mix in symbols, default parameters, aliases, and several ways to do the same thing, programs can be very hard to follow. Digging through the Ruby on Rails source has left me scratching my head more than once.</li>
<li>I appreciate that introspection/reflection is made simple: just call Object.methods and you know the object&rsquo;s capabilities; call Object.class to find out its class.</li>
<li>I get tripped up by the handling of Nil, True, and False. Every object can be evaluated as a boolean, but things like empty strings, empty arrays and hashes, so you end up with lots of conditionals that check for nil or empty. The Rails helper method blank? is nice, but it does not work as expected with booleans. Also all integer values evaluate to true&ndash;even 0. As an Electrical/Computer Engineer I think computers have 1s and 0s&ndash;not trues and falses&ndash;and a 0 should map to false. A nil object is false, but not all false evaluations are caused by a nil; this can necessitate extra processing to determine why the program branched the way it did.</li>
<li>I love the range and capability of built-in functions! For example, you can turn any object into a string (Object.to_s). Need to generate permutations, just use <a title="Ruby: Array - Permutation" href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/core/classes/Array.html#M000287">Array.permutations</a>. Dealing with peoples&#8217; names? You can use <a title="Ruby: String - Capitalize" href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/core/classes/String.html#M001157">String.capitalize</a> to capitalize the first letter of each word in the string.</li>
<li>Sometimes I have to wonder &ldquo;who named the great built-in functions?&rdquo; Can the non-standard names be explained by the language creator being Japanese or are the names just strange for me? For example in <a title="Ruby: Array" href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/core/classes/Array.html">Array</a> there are several similar methods like flatten vs flatten! vs to_a vs to_ary, as well as to_s vs inspect. In <a title="Ruby: String" href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/core/classes/String.html">String</a> there&rsquo;s chomp, chop, strip, squeeze&hellip; which one trims? Sure, I&rsquo;ve learned now but it is not obvious in my opinion.</li>
<li>The Ruby convention is that &ldquo;dangerous&rdquo; methods are supposed to have an exclamation point, which can get confusing when exclamation points are also the NOT operator. The dangerous methods can act in place or return nil. The return bit breaks consistency because you have to selectively assign variables instead of using a standard pattern. @var = @string.strip! will make @var nil if your @string does not have whitespace (leaving @string unchanged) or it will make @var the stripped string, but @string is also changed. @var is properly assigned if you omit the exclamation point and just use @var = @string.strip.</li>
<li>Along the lines of the &ldquo;dangerous&rdquo; methods, methods that return a boolean should have a question mark like Object.nil?. Is the following line clear to you? @var.nil? ? @var.strip : @var.strip! A little trivia: the method! and method? is a convention borrowed from Scheme.</li>
<li>Operator precedence is tricky; for example, &amp;&amp; is equivalent to and, yet they have different precedence. Similar with or vs ||, not vs !</li>
<li>The community is great, but the divide between Ruby and Rails is sometimes too narrow. I recently tried to find a Ruby solution and the top hits were Rails-specific. This isn&rsquo;t bad if you&rsquo;re doing Rails development, and it may be beneficial if patches make it into the language and the framework. I&rsquo;ll be curious to see how this unfolds.</li>
</ul>


<p>That&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;ve got for now! Did I miss something?</p>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/my-latex-resume-template/">My LaTeX resume template</a></h1>
      <p>Several years ago I started writing my <a href="https://github.com/smholloway/resume/tree/master/latex">resume in LaTeX</a>. It was a great way to learn LaTeX and have fine-grained control over my resume. Overall, I&rsquo;m pleased with it, but I must admit that updating and recompiling the file can be a chore.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve had several people ask for my LaTeX resume template, so I figured I would share the wealth. You can find my custom resume file, mostly reduced to a template, in the <a href="https://github.com/smholloway/resume/tree/master/latex">latex folder of my resume repo on GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>To generate your resume, download and edit the .tex file, then compile (I use pdflatex on Mac, Windows, and Linux). Et voila! You have a nice looking PDF resume.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong> Here&rsquo;s my reply to the question from Yash.</p>

<div>I&#8217;m not sure I understand exactly what you want, but I would start by inserting a new contact section</div>


<div></div>


<div><span style="font-family: 'courier new', monospace;">\contact{Yash}{}{}{}</span></div>


<div></div>


<div></div>


<div>You could also create a new contact command, say a contact header. Compared to the standard contact command you remove the centering and trim it down to whatever number of arguments you want. Here&#8217;s an example for a left-aligned name.</div>


<div></div>


<div><span style="font-family: 'courier new', monospace;">\newcommand{\contactHeader}[1]{</span></div>


<div><span style="font-family: 'courier new', monospace;"> \begin{changemargin}{-0.5in}{-0.5in}</span></div>


<div><span style="font-family: 'courier new', monospace;">    {\Large \scshape {#1}}&#92; \smallskip</span></div>


<div><span style="font-family: 'courier new', monospace;"> \end{changemargin}</span></div>


<div>}</div>


<div></div>


<div></div>


<div>To control the spacing, consider forcing a newpage, then inserting the header like so</div>


<div></div>


<div><span style="font-family: 'courier new', monospace;">\newpage </span></div>


<div><span style="font-family: 'courier new', monospace;"> </span></div>


<div><span style="font-family: 'courier new', monospace;">\contactHeader{Yash}).</span></div>


<div></div>


<p>Beyond that, you&rsquo;re on your own! Tinker a bit and see what you come up with.</p>

Heroku is a free (for basic service) Ruby on Rails hosting environment running in the cloud (Amazon EC2 in this case). Heroku is super simple to set up and use because you deploy with Git! The Git backing encourages version control and allows you to push bug fixes to your central repository as well as the productive server.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve played with other free hosting sites and services, blogs and social media, and cloud platforms like EC2 and Google App Engine&hellip; the Heroku workflow beats all of them. I can&rsquo;t think of an easier way to develop, test, and deploy! It seems that no one else can either: there are a lot of projects and posts about how to emulate this style in your own environment; there are also alternatives for node.js (like <a title="Joyent's node.js hosting environment" href="https://no.de/">Joyent&rsquo;s no.de service</a>), PHP (like <a title="PHP Fog" href="https://phpfog.com/">PHP Fog</a>), and word is that Heroku is working to allow all platforms. I look forward to a future where software development, setup, test, and deployment are easy and integrated in the process!</p>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/a-couple-quick-google-search-tricks/">A couple quick Google search tricks</a></h1>
      <p>I recently stumbled upon these tricks and thought others might find them interesting too; for example, I now know that I&rsquo;m the top hit for people searching for Seth Holloway in France.</p>

<p>To see results from a different location you can either</p>

<ul>
<li>go to the Google site you&rsquo;re interested in and append &ldquo;ncr&rdquo; to the URL (e.g., <a href="http://www.google.co.kr/ncr">http://www.google.co.kr/ncr</a> to see Korean search results) or</li>
<li>use the gl=&lt;two letter location&gt; parameter (e.g., <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=blah&amp;amp;gl=KR">http://www.google.com/search?q=blah&amp;amp;gl=KR</a>).</li>
</ul>


<p>To avoid personalization - add the <code>pws=0</code> flag</p>

<p>I found a nice example from an <a title="SEOmoz - how can I view google..." href="http://www.seomoz.org/q/how-can-i-view-google-com-serps-from-outside-the-us">SEOmoz article on how to retrieve results for a specific location without actually being in that location</a>:</p>

<blockquote>Use this as a model: http://www.google.com/search?q=your+search+query&amp;pws=0&amp;gl=US (obviously put your search query in where it says your+search+query (separated by plus signs)).

Broken down:

www.google.com - the search engine you want

pws=0 - remove any personalization

gl=US - return results as if you were in the US

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/the-merits-of-a-phd/">The merits of a PhD</a></h1>
      <p>I just found this buried at the bottom of my drafts&hellip; whoops! Soon I will post updated thoughts now that I&rsquo;ve completed the PhD&hellip;</p>

<blockquote>Whenever I tell people I am working on my PhD, I see two polarized opinions. One, my preferred response, is amazement. I do appreciate the approval.

The other response flows from people who do not believe a PhD is worthwhile. In terms of average income earned over a lifetime, the PhD is statistically out-earned by the MS. To this point I assert that correlation is not causation. In large companies and government organizations, PhDs are moving out of the labs and into management roles; among start-ups&#8211;a new idea in America&#8211;PhDs are more prevalent than in large organizations. Once the income earned from the new class of PhDs (those in management and those at start-ups) is fed into the equation, we may find that income is always proportional to level of education.

Another point that I&#8217;ve heard repeatedly attempts to diminish the PhD by pointing out the small-scale distribution of research. Yes, it is true that few people will ever read a PhD dissertation despite the fact that the dissertation is the culmination of thousands of hours of effort. However, to graduate a PhD candidate normally publishes a number of peer-reviewed papers that are read by others in the area; the candidate also has to defend his/her research to a group of eagle-eyed professors.

For me, the PhD is about self-fulfillment&#8211;the ability to stick with it and accomplish a difficult task. I&#8217;m not out for fortune or fame, and I hope that people I meet, whether they agree or disagree with the PhD, are equally realistic about their own life.</blockquote>
