      <p>TV is such a dinosaur! If I see something I want in a commercial, I have to use a second&mdash;maybe even third&mdash;device to find out more and buy it. Let&rsquo;s say I see a movie trailer and I decide I want to see the movie; currently, the onus is on me to remember. Because we have poor memories, we are inundated with the same trailer as an artificial memory aid.</p>

<p>If a movie is coming out on video, I would like to be able to add it to my Netflix queue or have a reminder to check it out on Redbox. If I see a product that I&rsquo;d like to buy, it would be nice to have a simpler method than visiting a website, calling a specified number, or both. Voting, like on American Idol, is another clear example of where TV could be more interactive.</p>

<p>Today we have Internet-enabled TVs and on-demand programs, but that&rsquo;s done little to improve the interactivity. Why have we seen disappointingly little innovation in TV?</p>

      <p>I&rsquo;ve been watching a lot of videos from conferences recently, and I&rsquo;ve noticed a disturbing trend: speakers say &ldquo;right&rdquo; a lot. Like every sentence. The old stand-bys &ldquo;like&rdquo; and &ldquo;uh&rdquo; have been usurped by &ldquo;right.&rdquo; You&rsquo;ve noticed this too, right? ;&ndash;)</p>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/keeping-up-with-technology/">Keeping up with Technology</a></h1>
      <p>Keeping up with technology sometimes feels like a full-time job. Everyday there are new and interesting books, articles, projects, videos and more coming out! That&rsquo;s on top of ton of history that is worth learning (and not repeating). And that just covers industry. Academia piles on even more to master.</p>

<p>At first, learning all these things feels completely overwhelming; however, once you build a base and learn how to learn, it is not so bad. Graduate school hones these skills, as does working in a fast-paced, dynamic environment. If neither is an option, experiment with the different mediums below and you will reap the rewards.</p>

<p>Below is a list of ways that I keep up with technology. The list is organized as person-to-person and solo.</p>

<p>If you have a different approach or a great site, please let me know!</p>

<h1>Person-to-person</h1>

<p>People are social creatures. We are one of the only species capable of learning from others, so person-to-person is a very natural avenue. That being said, it does require more time and energy to alter your routine and attend these structured events.</p>

<h2>Local events</h2>

<p>If you&rsquo;re feeling social, local meetings are a fantastic way to find smart, interesting people. Around Austin we have something technical happening virtually every night of the month (see these lists: <a href="http://door64.com/calendar?" target="_blank"><a href="http://door64.com/calendar?">http://door64.com/calendar?</a></a> | <a href="http://geekaustin.org/guide-austin-tech-meetups" target="_blank"><a href="http://geekaustin.org/guide-austin-tech-meetups">http://geekaustin.org/guide-austin-tech-meetups</a></a> | Austin Tech Meetups: <a href="http://www.meetup.com/find/?mcName=Austin&amp;categories=34" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.meetup.com/find/?mcName=Austin&amp;amp;categories=34">http://www.meetup.com/find/?mcName=Austin&amp;amp;categories=34</a></a>). A couple that I&rsquo;ve been to and enjoyed include the <a title="Austin Java User's Group" href="http://www.austinjug.org/" target="_blank">Austin Java User’s Group</a> and <a title="Austin on Rails" href="http://austinonrails.org/" target="_blank">Austin on Rails</a>.</p>

<h2>Conferences</h2>

<p>There are a number of potentially worthwhile conferences, both academic and industrial. I&rsquo;ve been to several academic conferences, which were worthwhile for graduate research. I have not been to an industry conference, but I&rsquo;d be interested to attend <a title="No Fluff Just Stuff Conference" href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/home/main" target="_blank">No Fluff Just Stuff</a> and <a title="The Strange Loop Conference" href="https://thestrangeloop.com/" target="_blank">Strange Loop</a>.</p>

<h2>Groups and Mailing Lists, Twitter, and Google Plus</h2>

<p>Personally, I prefer website interactions, but I would be remiss if I omitted social media and newsgroups. While you can choose to lurk with all of these methods, at least the opportunities for interaction are there :)</p>

<p>Want to keep up with what&rsquo;s going on with Clojure? Just join the <a title="Clojure on Google Groups" href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/clojure">Clojure mailing list</a>. Whatever you&rsquo;re interested in, search for the group and join it. You can also follow the discussion on Twitter or Google Plus. This is a great way to find out who&rsquo;s who in the community.</p>

<h1>Solo</h1>

<p>If you&rsquo;re not feeling social, there are a ton of more solitary options. I love the asynchronous nature of in-person learning: if I have five minutes I can sneak in some learning without coordinating with anyone else.</p>

<h2>Books</h2>

<p>I like to balance theory and application, so I split time between learning by doing and learning by reading. Two of my favorite books (below) concisely capture years of lessons learned and provide a vocabulary for interacting with others in the field.</p>

<ul>
<li><a title="Amazon: Clean Code" href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0132350882">Clean Code by Robert Martin</a></li>
<li><a title="Amazon: The Pragmatic Programmer" href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/020161622X">The Pragmatic Programmer by Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas</a></li>
</ul>

</ul>


<h2>Websites</h2>

<p>There&rsquo;s a website for everything, right? The trick is finding worthwhile ones. A few of my favorite aggregators are</p>

<ul>
<li>Hacker <a href="News:%C2%A0">News:%C2%A0</a><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/">http://news.ycombinator.com/</a></li>
<li>Reddit Programming: <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Programming" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Programming">http://www.reddit.com/r/Programming</a></a></li>
<li>InfoQ: <a href="http://www.infoq.com/" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.infoq.com/">http://www.infoq.com/</a></a></li>
</ul>


<p>From here, I can find interesting articles and people to follow.</p>

<p>To keep up with myriad websites, I recommend RSS, particularly <a title="Google Reader" href="http://www.google.com/reader/" target="_blank">Google Reader</a>, which is free&mdash;you just need a Google account. Reader links to Plus fairly easily, so you can share interesting content pretty easily.</p>

<h2>Podcasts</h2>

<p>For iOS devices, I love the Downcast app (<a href="http://www.downcastapp.com/" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.downcastapp.com/">http://www.downcastapp.com/</a></a>). Some of my favorite podcasts so far include</p>

<ul>
<li><a title="Software Engineering Radio podcast" href="http://www.se-radio.net/" target="_blank">Software Engineering Radio</a></li>
<li><a title="Java Posse" href="http://javaposse.com/" target="_blank">Java Posse</a></li>
<li><a title="Ruby Rogues" href="http://rubyrogues.com/" target="_blank">Ruby Rogues</a></li>
<li><a title="Herding Code" href="http://herdingcode.com/" target="_blank">Herding Code</a></li>
</ul>


<h2>Online Learning and Videos</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve covered online learning previously, so I will simply point to my post <a title="Online Learning is Taking Off" href="http://sethholloway.com/blog/2012/07/22/online-learning-is-taking-off/" target="_blank">Online Learning is Taking Off</a>.</p>

<h2>Read Code</h2>

<p>Some would say that reading code is as important as writing code. Luckily, code is easier to find than ever! For example, check out a popular repo lik <a title="browse Google Guava source" href="http://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/source/browse/" target="_blank">Google Guava</a> or let <a title="GitHub Explore" href="https://github.com/explore" target="_blank">GitHub guide you</a>.</p>

<h2>What do you think?</h2>

<p>Did I miss something? Would you categorize differently? What&rsquo;s your preferred method of keeping up with tech?</p>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/twiki-health-checker/">Twiki Health Checker</a></h1>
      <p>A few months ago I got tired of staring at pages of cruft while navigating the Twiki at work. My friend and peer, Otto, suggested that we try to filter those less-than-helpful posts. I couldn&rsquo;t find any tools to help non-administrators, so I figured I&rsquo;d need to write something myself. That night I wrote some JavaScript to quickly find posts in the Twiki WebIndex that were outdated or written by an unknown author. Once found, the entries are highlighted. The idea was that people would run the code against the Twiki, then delete the marked entries. After a couple code reviews (thanks Derek and Nick!), the script was packaged and put onto GitHub as the <a title="GitHub - Seth Holloway - TwikiChecker" href="https://github.com/smholloway/TwikiChecker">TwikiChecker</a> a.k.a. Twiki Health Checker.</p>

<p><img class="size-large wp-image-1804" title="TwikiChecker run on Twiki WebIndex" src="/images/delthis-1024x399.png" alt="TwikiChecker run on Twiki WebIndex" width="640" height="249" /></p>

<p>Try running it for yourself on the official Twiki page, <a title="http://twiki.org/cgi-bin/view/TWiki/WebIndex" href="http://twiki.org/cgi-bin/view/TWiki/WebIndex"><a href="http://twiki.org/cgi-bin/view/TWiki/WebIndex">http://twiki.org/cgi-bin/view/TWiki/WebIndex</a></a>. (Copy the contents of TwikiChecker.js, navigate to the Twiki WebIndex, open your browser&rsquo;s JavaScript console, paste in the contents and hit enter.)</p>

<p>Hopefully this is useful for others!</p>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/whats-your-average-likert-scale-response/">What&#8217;s your average Likert scale response?</a></h1>
      <p>Have you ever seen a question where you select an answer from a set list like <em>Strongly disagree</em>, <em>Disagree</em>, <em>Neither agree nor disagree</em>, <em>Agree</em>, and <em>Strongly agree</em>? that&rsquo;s a <a title="Wikipedia: Likert Scale" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likert_scale">Likert scale</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cc/Example_Likert_Scale.svg/220px-Example_Likert_Scale.svg.png"><img class="alignnone" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cc/Example_Likert_Scale.svg/220px-Example_Likert_Scale.svg.png" alt="" width="220" height="334" /></a></p>

<p>Crafting a survey like this is very straightforward and easy, but doing it well is very difficult! For example, this style of survey is lacking the granularity necessary to capture answers like, &ldquo;I can see both sides&rdquo; or &ldquo;Not applicable&rdquo; or &ldquo;This question warrants a richer discussion and should not be shoe-horned into a simple yes or no question.&rdquo; Let&rsquo;s forget about the problems and instead focus on appropriate usage of the Likert scale.</p>

<p>Think about the last questionnaire like this that you completed. What was your average response? I&rsquo;ll guess your responses were entirely in one column (more precisely, your standard deviation between responses was low). If you were asked about a crappy restaurant experience you might answer all negatively: that the food was bad, the service was bad, the decor was bad, and the price was bad. If you were asked about your feelings about something you didn&rsquo;t care about you would probably hover around the middle choice (<em>Neither agree nor disagree</em> in our example above).</p>

<p>Personally, I think that presenting an odd number of options is folly. In my experience, people choose the middle option most often. The middle is safe and easy. But that&rsquo;s not informative! Questions should not be simplified into <em>Neither agree nor disagree</em>. Everyone feels more strongly one way or another.</p>

<p>The next time you respond to a survey that uses a Likert scale, do this:</p>

<ul>
<li>remember the term &ldquo;Likert scale&rdquo; and applaud yourself for exercising your knowledge</li>
<li>avoid the simple middle answer&mdash;think a second and decide if you really feel a bit more to one side</li>
<li>take note of how positive or negative you are</li>
</ul>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/summer-of-learning-and-teaching/">Summer of Learning and Teaching</a></h1>
      <p>A grad school friend who I respect a lot once told me &lsquo;If you&rsquo;re good, it is your job to help others be good; if you&rsquo;re not good, your job is to learn and get better.&rsquo; That stuck with me and shaped my worldview&mdash;I now expect that others feel the same.</p>

<p>I have plenty to learn, but I have been blessed to learn a lot of things about a lot of things so I felt it was my duty to help. As such, this summer I initiated the Summer of Learning and Teaching at work. Originally, I wanted to help bring new hires and interns up to speed; however, I&rsquo;m hoping that with each session every audience member will learn something new and the presenter will learn (improve) presentation skills.</p>

<p>Thankfully, I have received fantastic support from management and my peers! We have had six sessions so far, and it&rsquo;s been great! I presented the four topics below and will now hand presenting off to peers so that others will have a chance to share something they are passionate about like databases, QA, Maven, and version control (Git).</p>

<p>Sessions I have led:</p>

<ul>
<li><a title="Introduction to HTML by Seth Holloway" href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1uHnZ9Rj1543ZRc4Fkql9_F_WIFr9foPNw-oDbK6dKt8/edit">HTML</a>. Who knew such a simple markup language could be so hard to teach? I tried to provide a quick overview and some helpful links so that people were empowered to keep learning.</li>
<li><a title="Introduction to CSS by Seth Holloway" href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1yyreIxkDb2Ay0-q2y3W9Q-wTjrm1I4NU4aWvaWuaMb4/edit">CSS</a>. I&rsquo;ve been making websites since 1999&hellip; how do you condense that into an hour? I think style is very hard for the average engineer. Rather than try to teach design, I took the tact of trying to show some common scenarios like how to center text or a block.</li>
<li><a title="Introduction to JavaScript by Seth Holloway" href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Qk_tJM_VDZlsZyaYA8Yjzl7V6hpuxCqk48zWWlPLW_s/edit">JavaScript</a>. As I&rsquo;ve learned more JavaScript I&rsquo;ve become increasingly comfortable with functional aspects and general trickery (type coercion, self-invoking functions, default values with || assignment, etc), but I had to set those concepts aside. I had to remember that this was not the time to talk about JavaScript&rsquo;s dark corners, although I had to fit some of that in ;&ndash;)</li>
<li><a title="Clean Code by Seth Holloway and Nick Dollarhide" href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1xlNFEi5q6UNcgJ4Ch-qygFP805RFbSaF9DGoF7uQOoE/edit">Clean Code</a>. I worked with my friend and co-worker Nick Dollarhide on this presentation. Nick did a phenomenal job! I thought his passion and intellect came through in the course of the talk. I&rsquo;d say this presentation was my favorite.</li>
</ul>


<p>I have learned a lot as I create the course materials and present for as long as 75 minutes. A few lessons I would share:</p>

<ul>
<li>everyone likes cookies!</li>
<li>pre-test so you know what to cover</li>
<li>practice, practice, practice</li>
<li>go through setting up ahead of time</li>
<li>show up ~15 minutes early to set up</li>
<li>bring water for yourself, then drink every time there is an opening or anytime you need to slow down</li>
</ul>


<p>This round of presentations feels different than others I&rsquo;ve given, and I&rsquo;ve presented quite a bit. In 2006 I presented to over 250 IBM executives to conclude the Extreme Blue internship. For me, that presentation was a well-rehearsed blur carried by our fantastic MBA, Carl Timm. I proposed and defended to 5+ professors and a dozen or so peers. Presenting an idea that you are an expert at (simply put, you should be the expert in your PhD topic) is very different; in some ways it is incredibly nerve-wracking, but you also have the assurance that you know your stuff. I&rsquo;ve presented at a few conferences, which felt similar to my proposal/defense except there was less pressure because the audience could not prevent me from graduating (at least not as easily ;&ndash;)). Throughout grad school I taught classes here and there, but they were mostly book reports or following a professor&rsquo;s curriculum. Setting your own curriculum and creating the materials in one week is really hard! Being &ldquo;on&rdquo; for an hour is tiring, yet strangely energizing too.</p>

<p>All in all, I&rsquo;m proud of the Summer of Learning and Teaching and I look forward to learning and teaching a bit more.</p>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/why-are-software-tools-so-bad/">Why are software tools so bad?</a></h1>
      <p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking about software development a lot recently, as I have for many years, and I keep wondering why our tools are so bad.</p>

<p>Today it struck me that software developers are one of the only groups who even have a chance to change their tools: our tools are created using our primary skill (programming)! Nurses cannot <em>nurse</em> a more effective stethoscope into being. Bakers cannot <em>bake</em> a better pie pan. Authors cannot <em>write</em> a smoother pen. Accountants cannot <em>calculate</em> a different tax code. Programmers can <em>program</em> more effective tools! But we don&rsquo;t. (At least not very quickly.) Professions whose skills are not directly related to their tools have a pass; we, software developers, do not.</p>

<p><img class="alignnone" title="A better world is possible" src="http://t1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRVX5TMdCeipxDB1YwVuPRsZyEfoWQXsYPXRdq8Py_BSHxiWpWB6FFsSTniIw" alt="A better world is possible" width="224" height="225" /></p>

<p>How many hours have been spent learning vim, emacs, Eclipse, or any of the various other editors people are using? How many hours were spent manipulating an editor to bend the tool to our will? How long has humanity  collectively spent tweaking a class path, fixing an out-of-date reference, or upgrading to the proper version of some package? How much time was wasted wrestling with version control (for example, counteracting bad check-ins or tracking down the author who forgot to include a necessary file)? How many people are dispatched to find a silly build break?</p>

<p>Perhaps all that time would have been better spent creating something that more closely matched our mental models or adjusting tools to the way we think and work. Bret Victor&rsquo;s talk (<a href="http://vimeo.com/36579366">Bret Victor &ndash; Inventing on Principle</a>) recently made its way around the net and inspired some people, but I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ve really internalized the message. Forcing people to play computer (compile large amounts of code in their head) and debug issues outside the scope of their project is passe! I hope we quit wasting human capital and improve software tools! (Soon, I hope to write a few cogent posts about what I think can be done.)</p>

<p>Do you agree that tools could be better? Why are the tools so bad? What tools are the biggest offenders? What&rsquo;s the most frustrating aspect of developing software that is not directly related to the logic of your task? If you had infinite time and resources, what would you fix or build?</p>

      <p>I just completed the <a title="2012 State of Clojure survey" href="http://cemerick.com/2012/07/19/2012-state-of-clojure-survey/">2012 State of Clojure survey</a> and it got me thinking about how to fairly judge languages like Clojure. We need new software metrics. Performance is easy to quantify: write a program, run it a lot, and measure the time it took. Do that across multiple languages, and you can find a winner (the one offering the most operations per time). For example, check <a title="Debian Language Shootout" href="http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/">Debian&rsquo;s Language Shootout</a> where Fortran and C rule. However, solely measuring performance misses a bigger (in my opinion) problem: development speed and ease-of-use. In my limited experience, Clojure is significantly shorter and easier to reason about that equivalent C projects. To be fair, it&rsquo;s been a while since I wrote much in C, but Clojure has also been easier to understand and change than Java code. In addition, Clojure programs are (basically) concurrent out-of-the-box. I think concurrency is generally very difficult and error-prone; however, concurrency is increasingly necessary&mdash;making Clojure that much stronger. But none of that is captured in common metrics.</p>

<p><img class="alignleft" style="margin-right: 30px;" title="Software Metrics book cover" src="http://ourcraft.files.wordpress.com/2009/08/software-metrics-cover-scan.jpg" alt="Software Metrics book cover" width="59" height="89" />
With the availability of lots of developers online I think we could tackle harder to quantify metrics like</p>

<ul>
<li>performance per line of code</li>
<li>performance per development time</li>
<li>performance per noob minute</li>
<li>comprehensibility per time</li>
<li>time to change a line of code</li>
</ul>


<p>The first pass on how to achieve this (tons of issues, no doubt): survey all the developers you can find. Collect all the information you can through the survey and GitHub tie-ins then ask people to perform tasks like explaining a piece of code and writing/changing programs across languages. An automated approach might start by finding a series of program solutions (from a set like <a title="99 Bottles of Beer" href="http://99-bottles-of-beer.net/">99 Bottles of Beer</a>, <a title="Project Euler Problems" href="http://projecteuler.net/problems">Project Euler</a>, <a title="Rosetta Code" href="http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Rosetta_Code">Rosetta Code</a>, or <a title="99 Problems in Scala" href="http://99problemsinscala.wordpress.com/">99 Problems in X</a>), then gather data about each solution and people&rsquo;s feelings about each. Maybe you could seed a bug and see how long it takes people to find and fix the bug.</p>

<p>Have I missed better software metrics? What metrics define a language you want to write in?  How can we accurately collect those metrics?</p>

      <p>Education is changing&mdash;big time! I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ll see many people leave or bypass universities for another 10 years, but we are getting back on track for the &lsquo;Information Age&rsquo; (as social media and memes settle in to their new home).</p>

<p>Online learning has evolved tremendously over the past year, with new offerings from some of the world&rsquo;s most famous professors and experts. Amazing programmers have created accessible, often beautiful, interfaces with intuitive lessons and exercises. People are experimenting with delivery methods ranging from YouTube videos and podcasts to interactive code tutorials and multiple choice questions. These are exciting times!</p>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/features-i-wish-netflix-would-add/">Features I wish Netflix would add</a></h1>
      <p>Preface: I like Netflix, and I&rsquo;ve been happily using the service for years.</p>

<p>When Netflix changed their service last year, a lot of people quit using the service. To this day, I feel that Netflix has lost customers and is succeeding due in part to their monopoly. Too many other companies can compete in the streaming video business (or they think they can, at least); however, <a title="Wikipedia - Netflix Prize" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix_Prize">Netflix has an amazing algorithm to predict how much you will like a movie</a>. If I were a product manager for Netflix I would showcase the ranking system and add a few new features to improve the user experience, rebuild the brand, and differentiate from the competition.</p>

<p>Before I discuss the features I would like to see added, let me explain a bit about how I use Netflix. I watch Netflix almost exclusively on my TV connected to my PS3. My tastes are pretty diverse and I watch all kinds of content (educational TV shows to samurai movies). My queue has contained over 50 items for almost as long as I&rsquo;ve had Netflix.</p>

<p>With that in mind, here are a few features that would improve my Netflix experience:</p>

<p><strong>Sorting</strong>. When looking at a list of movies, it would be nice to be able to sort, particularly by stars. Netflix has so much content! I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll stoop to the 1 or 2 star level anytime soon, so show those items last, or not at all. Showcase the ranking algorithm that can predict what I&rsquo;ll like!</p>

<p><strong>Filtering</strong>. Filtering is an extension to sorting, I think. With all the content, it is hard to wade through everything. As I said with sorting, I don&rsquo;t plan to watch movies below 3 stars, so let me filter those out. I&rsquo;m also not a fan of old movies, in general, so it would be nice to nix anything before some date. Often, I fire up Netflix with a vague notion of what I want to watch, but nothing particular in mind; it would be nice to find movies based on tags or multiple genres (like comedy and action). For example, one of our common searches boils down to a comedy made in the last 10 years; unfortunately, we have to keep those criteria in mind as we look through various queues (instant, comedy, new releases, recently added). I think there&rsquo;s ample precedent of filtering interfaces (particularly in shopping sites like Amazon, Old Navy, Newegg, etc), so users would have little resistance to this change.</p>

<p><strong>Guided decision making</strong>. Why not help people find something good to watch? The interface does a pretty good job of presenting a subset of content, but the sheer number of options can be overwhelming. This leads to choice-paralysis where it&rsquo;s easier to watch nothing than to decide on the hundreds of options. To streamline the process, I would create a guided path that leads to a movie or a small subset of movies. For example, formalize the decision making process that is something like this: &ldquo;I want a [classic|modern|new] [choose genre] [choose sub-genre] movie that is [short|medium|long].&rdquo; This would also allow the user to find deeper content as well (the content that doesn&rsquo;t fit in the 75 item lists shown in the current interface).</p>

<p><strong>Intermediate &ldquo;staging&rdquo; area</strong>. Almost every time I have turned on Netflix I&rsquo;ve scrolled through my queue trying to find something to watch. I&rsquo;ll find maybe five items then decide what to watch off the short list. When watching with other people, we generally reach a group decision based on everyone&rsquo;s input (Person A is game for &ldquo;The Big Lebowski,&rdquo; Person B wants to watch &ldquo;Snatch,&rdquo; and I&rsquo;m feeling &ldquo;Låt den rätte komma in&rdquo;). This is another instance where a computer could assist effortlessly, but I have to hold all the information in my head.</p>

<p>There are other things Netflix could do (like increasing the amount and quality of content), but I think the above features could be easily achieved and provide a lot of bang for the buck.</p>

<p>What features do you think are missing? Do you use Netflix like I do? What would you like to see added or improved?</p>
