      <p>A grad school friend who I respect a lot once told me &lsquo;If you&rsquo;re good, it is your job to help others be good; if you&rsquo;re not good, your job is to learn and get better.&rsquo; That stuck with me and shaped my worldview&mdash;I now expect that others feel the same.</p>

<p>I have plenty to learn, but I have been blessed to learn a lot of things about a lot of things so I felt it was my duty to help. As such, this summer I initiated the Summer of Learning and Teaching at work. Originally, I wanted to help bring new hires and interns up to speed; however, I&rsquo;m hoping that with each session every audience member will learn something new and the presenter will learn (improve) presentation skills.</p>

<p>Thankfully, I have received fantastic support from management and my peers! We have had six sessions so far, and it&rsquo;s been great! I presented the four topics below and will now hand presenting off to peers so that others will have a chance to share something they are passionate about like databases, QA, Maven, and version control (Git).</p>

<p>Sessions I have led:</p>

<ul>
<li><a title="Introduction to HTML by Seth Holloway" href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1uHnZ9Rj1543ZRc4Fkql9_F_WIFr9foPNw-oDbK6dKt8/edit">HTML</a>. Who knew such a simple markup language could be so hard to teach? I tried to provide a quick overview and some helpful links so that people were empowered to keep learning.</li>
<li><a title="Introduction to CSS by Seth Holloway" href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1yyreIxkDb2Ay0-q2y3W9Q-wTjrm1I4NU4aWvaWuaMb4/edit">CSS</a>. I&rsquo;ve been making websites since 1999&hellip; how do you condense that into an hour? I think style is very hard for the average engineer. Rather than try to teach design, I took the tact of trying to show some common scenarios like how to center text or a block.</li>
<li><a title="Introduction to JavaScript by Seth Holloway" href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Qk_tJM_VDZlsZyaYA8Yjzl7V6hpuxCqk48zWWlPLW_s/edit">JavaScript</a>. As I&rsquo;ve learned more JavaScript I&rsquo;ve become increasingly comfortable with functional aspects and general trickery (type coercion, self-invoking functions, default values with || assignment, etc), but I had to set those concepts aside. I had to remember that this was not the time to talk about JavaScript&rsquo;s dark corners, although I had to fit some of that in ;&ndash;)</li>
<li><a title="Clean Code by Seth Holloway and Nick Dollarhide" href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1xlNFEi5q6UNcgJ4Ch-qygFP805RFbSaF9DGoF7uQOoE/edit">Clean Code</a>. I worked with my friend and co-worker Nick Dollarhide on this presentation. Nick did a phenomenal job! I thought his passion and intellect came through in the course of the talk. I&rsquo;d say this presentation was my favorite.</li>
</ul>


<p>I have learned a lot as I create the course materials and present for as long as 75 minutes. A few lessons I would share:</p>

<ul>
<li>everyone likes cookies!</li>
<li>pre-test so you know what to cover</li>
<li>practice, practice, practice</li>
<li>go through setting up ahead of time</li>
<li>show up ~15 minutes early to set up</li>
<li>bring water for yourself, then drink every time there is an opening or anytime you need to slow down</li>
</ul>


<p>This round of presentations feels different than others I&rsquo;ve given, and I&rsquo;ve presented quite a bit. In 2006 I presented to over 250 IBM executives to conclude the Extreme Blue internship. For me, that presentation was a well-rehearsed blur carried by our fantastic MBA, Carl Timm. I proposed and defended to 5+ professors and a dozen or so peers. Presenting an idea that you are an expert at (simply put, you should be the expert in your PhD topic) is very different; in some ways it is incredibly nerve-wracking, but you also have the assurance that you know your stuff. I&rsquo;ve presented at a few conferences, which felt similar to my proposal/defense except there was less pressure because the audience could not prevent me from graduating (at least not as easily ;&ndash;)). Throughout grad school I taught classes here and there, but they were mostly book reports or following a professor&rsquo;s curriculum. Setting your own curriculum and creating the materials in one week is really hard! Being &ldquo;on&rdquo; for an hour is tiring, yet strangely energizing too.</p>

<p>All in all, I&rsquo;m proud of the Summer of Learning and Teaching and I look forward to learning and teaching a bit more.</p>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/why-are-software-tools-so-bad/">Why are software tools so bad?</a></h1>
      <p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking about software development a lot recently, as I have for many years, and I keep wondering why our tools are so bad.</p>

<p>Today it struck me that software developers are one of the only groups who even have a chance to change their tools: our tools are created using our primary skill (programming)! Nurses cannot <em>nurse</em> a more effective stethoscope into being. Bakers cannot <em>bake</em> a better pie pan. Authors cannot <em>write</em> a smoother pen. Accountants cannot <em>calculate</em> a different tax code. Programmers can <em>program</em> more effective tools! But we don&rsquo;t. (At least not very quickly.) Professions whose skills are not directly related to their tools have a pass; we, software developers, do not.</p>

<p><img class="alignnone" title="A better world is possible" src="http://t1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRVX5TMdCeipxDB1YwVuPRsZyEfoWQXsYPXRdq8Py_BSHxiWpWB6FFsSTniIw" alt="A better world is possible" width="224" height="225" /></p>

<p>How many hours have been spent learning vim, emacs, Eclipse, or any of the various other editors people are using? How many hours were spent manipulating an editor to bend the tool to our will? How long has humanity  collectively spent tweaking a class path, fixing an out-of-date reference, or upgrading to the proper version of some package? How much time was wasted wrestling with version control (for example, counteracting bad check-ins or tracking down the author who forgot to include a necessary file)? How many people are dispatched to find a silly build break?</p>

<p>Perhaps all that time would have been better spent creating something that more closely matched our mental models or adjusting tools to the way we think and work. Bret Victor&rsquo;s talk (<a href="http://vimeo.com/36579366">Bret Victor &ndash; Inventing on Principle</a>) recently made its way around the net and inspired some people, but I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ve really internalized the message. Forcing people to play computer (compile large amounts of code in their head) and debug issues outside the scope of their project is passe! I hope we quit wasting human capital and improve software tools! (Soon, I hope to write a few cogent posts about what I think can be done.)</p>

<p>Do you agree that tools could be better? Why are the tools so bad? What tools are the biggest offenders? What&rsquo;s the most frustrating aspect of developing software that is not directly related to the logic of your task? If you had infinite time and resources, what would you fix or build?</p>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/new-software-metrics/">New Software Metrics</a></h1>
      <p>I just completed the <a title="2012 State of Clojure survey" href="http://cemerick.com/2012/07/19/2012-state-of-clojure-survey/">2012 State of Clojure survey</a> and it got me thinking about how to fairly judge languages like Clojure. We need new software metrics. Performance is easy to quantify: write a program, run it a lot, and measure the time it took. Do that across multiple languages, and you can find a winner (the one offering the most operations per time). For example, check <a title="Debian Language Shootout" href="http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/">Debian&rsquo;s Language Shootout</a> where Fortran and C rule. However, solely measuring performance misses a bigger (in my opinion) problem: development speed and ease-of-use. In my limited experience, Clojure is significantly shorter and easier to reason about that equivalent C projects. To be fair, it&rsquo;s been a while since I wrote much in C, but Clojure has also been easier to understand and change than Java code. In addition, Clojure programs are (basically) concurrent out-of-the-box. I think concurrency is generally very difficult and error-prone; however, concurrency is increasingly necessary&mdash;making Clojure that much stronger. But none of that is captured in common metrics.</p>

<p><img class="alignleft" style="margin-right: 30px;" title="Software Metrics book cover" src="http://ourcraft.files.wordpress.com/2009/08/software-metrics-cover-scan.jpg" alt="Software Metrics book cover" width="59" height="89" />
With the availability of lots of developers online I think we could tackle harder to quantify metrics like</p>

<ul>
<li>performance per line of code</li>
<li>performance per development time</li>
<li>performance per noob minute</li>
<li>comprehensibility per time</li>
<li>time to change a line of code</li>
</ul>


<p>The first pass on how to achieve this (tons of issues, no doubt): survey all the developers you can find. Collect all the information you can through the survey and GitHub tie-ins then ask people to perform tasks like explaining a piece of code and writing/changing programs across languages. An automated approach might start by finding a series of program solutions (from a set like <a title="99 Bottles of Beer" href="http://99-bottles-of-beer.net/">99 Bottles of Beer</a>, <a title="Project Euler Problems" href="http://projecteuler.net/problems">Project Euler</a>, <a title="Rosetta Code" href="http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Rosetta_Code">Rosetta Code</a>, or <a title="99 Problems in Scala" href="http://99problemsinscala.wordpress.com/">99 Problems in X</a>), then gather data about each solution and people&rsquo;s feelings about each. Maybe you could seed a bug and see how long it takes people to find and fix the bug.</p>

<p>Have I missed better software metrics? What metrics define a language you want to write in?  How can we accurately collect those metrics?</p>

      <p>Education is changing&mdash;big time! I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ll see many people leave or bypass universities for another 10 years, but we are getting back on track for the &lsquo;Information Age&rsquo; (as social media and memes settle in to their new home).</p>

<p>Online learning has evolved tremendously over the past year, with new offerings from some of the world&rsquo;s most famous professors and experts. Amazing programmers have created accessible, often beautiful, interfaces with intuitive lessons and exercises. People are experimenting with delivery methods ranging from YouTube videos and podcasts to interactive code tutorials and multiple choice questions. These are exciting times!</p>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/features-i-wish-netflix-would-add/">Features I wish Netflix would add</a></h1>
      <p>Preface: I like Netflix, and I&rsquo;ve been happily using the service for years.</p>

<p>When Netflix changed their service last year, a lot of people quit using the service. To this day, I feel that Netflix has lost customers and is succeeding due in part to their monopoly. Too many other companies can compete in the streaming video business (or they think they can, at least); however, <a title="Wikipedia - Netflix Prize" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix_Prize">Netflix has an amazing algorithm to predict how much you will like a movie</a>. If I were a product manager for Netflix I would showcase the ranking system and add a few new features to improve the user experience, rebuild the brand, and differentiate from the competition.</p>

<p>Before I discuss the features I would like to see added, let me explain a bit about how I use Netflix. I watch Netflix almost exclusively on my TV connected to my PS3. My tastes are pretty diverse and I watch all kinds of content (educational TV shows to samurai movies). My queue has contained over 50 items for almost as long as I&rsquo;ve had Netflix.</p>

<p>With that in mind, here are a few features that would improve my Netflix experience:</p>

<p><strong>Sorting</strong>. When looking at a list of movies, it would be nice to be able to sort, particularly by stars. Netflix has so much content! I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll stoop to the 1 or 2 star level anytime soon, so show those items last, or not at all. Showcase the ranking algorithm that can predict what I&rsquo;ll like!</p>

<p><strong>Filtering</strong>. Filtering is an extension to sorting, I think. With all the content, it is hard to wade through everything. As I said with sorting, I don&rsquo;t plan to watch movies below 3 stars, so let me filter those out. I&rsquo;m also not a fan of old movies, in general, so it would be nice to nix anything before some date. Often, I fire up Netflix with a vague notion of what I want to watch, but nothing particular in mind; it would be nice to find movies based on tags or multiple genres (like comedy and action). For example, one of our common searches boils down to a comedy made in the last 10 years; unfortunately, we have to keep those criteria in mind as we look through various queues (instant, comedy, new releases, recently added). I think there&rsquo;s ample precedent of filtering interfaces (particularly in shopping sites like Amazon, Old Navy, Newegg, etc), so users would have little resistance to this change.</p>

<p><strong>Guided decision making</strong>. Why not help people find something good to watch? The interface does a pretty good job of presenting a subset of content, but the sheer number of options can be overwhelming. This leads to choice-paralysis where it&rsquo;s easier to watch nothing than to decide on the hundreds of options. To streamline the process, I would create a guided path that leads to a movie or a small subset of movies. For example, formalize the decision making process that is something like this: &ldquo;I want a [classic|modern|new] [choose genre] [choose sub-genre] movie that is [short|medium|long].&rdquo; This would also allow the user to find deeper content as well (the content that doesn&rsquo;t fit in the 75 item lists shown in the current interface).</p>

<p><strong>Intermediate &ldquo;staging&rdquo; area</strong>. Almost every time I have turned on Netflix I&rsquo;ve scrolled through my queue trying to find something to watch. I&rsquo;ll find maybe five items then decide what to watch off the short list. When watching with other people, we generally reach a group decision based on everyone&rsquo;s input (Person A is game for &ldquo;The Big Lebowski,&rdquo; Person B wants to watch &ldquo;Snatch,&rdquo; and I&rsquo;m feeling &ldquo;Låt den rätte komma in&rdquo;). This is another instance where a computer could assist effortlessly, but I have to hold all the information in my head.</p>

<p>There are other things Netflix could do (like increasing the amount and quality of content), but I think the above features could be easily achieved and provide a lot of bang for the buck.</p>

<p>What features do you think are missing? Do you use Netflix like I do? What would you like to see added or improved?</p>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/i-dont-want-to-install-your-app/">I don&#8217;t want to install your app</a></h1>
      <p>I am getting tired of sites pushing their iPhone app while I am browsing on my iPhone! I&rsquo;m a minimalist, and I&rsquo;d prefer to have a small subset of useful apps. Here&rsquo;s a made up example that is very similar to what I&rsquo;ve encountered multiple times recently: I&rsquo;ll search for something simple like &ldquo;native plants in central texas,&rdquo; which will lead me to a site like Uncle Jim&rsquo;s Country Nursery and Feed Store (just an example&mdash;this site did not exist at the time of writing); the page load is interrupted by a modal dialog asking me to install their iPhone app. No! I don&rsquo;t want to install your app! I just want to see if this page has the information I&rsquo;m seeking (often, it does not).</p>

<p>While tablets and mobile devices will be the primary computer in the near future, I believe the web is the right way forward. There are at least two major mobile platforms (iOS and Android, not to mention Windows, BlackBerry, and any future platforms) requiring dramatically different applications. On the other hand, pursuing a web strategy requires only one app&mdash;an app that you need regardless of whether or not you create an app. My advice as a technologist (and my preference as a user) is to pour your efforts into making a solid website.</p>

      <p>Google Plus has been out for a while now, and, after giving it a try, I feel it&rsquo;s fair to say I preferred the Google Reader approach to social. Google Reader was central to my news consumption because I could keep track of hundreds of feeds and take advantage of social filtering (why subscribe to Lifehacker when a few people I follow share the stories I would have cared about?). In addition to excellent features as a news reader, I could kill endless amounts of time by commenting on others&#8217; shared posts.</p>

<p>With the introduction of Google Plus, Google removed the social aspects of Google Reader that were so engaging for me: (1) the ability to follow people and see their shared posts and (2) the ability to have conversations about those shared posts.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m largely underwhelmed by Plus and feel the void left by stripping down Google Reader. Sadly, I&rsquo;m not sure that any news reader can capture the same spirit, even if they can copy the features. And no company is likely to start on such a project given the lack of monetization. Oh well! It was good while it lasted&hellip;</p>

      <p>Passwords are simply not secure as evidenced by numerous password breaches and numerous hacks. Identity theft is increasingly common and increasingly harmful, so we need to evolve our security sooner rather than later. <a title="Wikipedia: two factor authentication" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-factor_authentication" target="_blank">Multi factor authentication</a> is a great way to improve security. In essence, we would augment our current password system with an additional factor (something the user possesses&mdash;like an RSA token or ATM card&mdash;or something unique to the user&rsquo;s person&mdash;like a fingerprint or retina scan).</p>

<p>Already, many companies distribute <a title="Two factor authentication - token generators" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-factor_authentication#Tokens_with_a_display_.28disconnected_tokens.29" target="_blank">RSA fobs</a> that cycle through a unique series of numbers; whenever an employee logs in with the correct password, a secondary check is issued and requires that the user input the number from the RSA device. A few banks offer this system, and <a title="Google offers two factor authentication" href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/02/advanced-sign-in-security-for-your.html" target="_blank">Google brought the same idea to their authentication system</a>.</p>

<p>Recently, I started using the Google system and I&rsquo;m pleased overall; however, I know that we can do better. Why require the user to type in an ever-changing key when we can get at that information another way? That is, use the user&rsquo;s phone to verify their location and only allow logins from known locations.</p>

<p>That simple idea is the basis of a company started by my friend and grad school peer, Evan. <a title="Two factor authentication done right " href="https://www.toopher.com/" target="_blank">Toopher</a> is two factor authentication made easy. For my convenience and security, I hope that sites use Toopher!</p>

      <p>TL;DR: If you see &ldquo;PWAT N AUSTIN MOTO AUSTIN TX&rdquo; on your statement, it&rsquo;s probably Painting with a Twist (PWAT).</p>

<p>Looking over my credit card statement I saw &ldquo;PWAT N AUSTIN MOTO AUSTIN TX&rdquo; and had no idea what it was. The random words made no sense to me. To make it even more confusing, my bank was categorizing the company as &ldquo;Organizations &ndash; MISC SCHOOLS / EDUCATIONAL SERVICES&rdquo;</p>

<p>Searching for the entire string led to results that were really keyed in on &ldquo;MOTO AUSTIN&rdquo; for some reason, which led to a lot of dead ends (we did not pay for motorcycle lessons or rent a motorcycle!).</p>

<p>After more searching I realized this charge is for <a title="Painting with a Twist" href="http://www.paintingwithatwist.com/">Painting With A Twist</a>! With that said, Painting With A Twist is a lot of fun. Andrea and I were able to quickly create some decent looking paintings in a relaxed environment.</p>

      <p>There are 10 types of people in this world: those who understand binary and those who don&rsquo;t. 10 in base 2 (binary) is 2 in base 10 (decimal&mdash;our standard number system) because 10 = 1<em>2<sup>1</sup> + 0</em>2<sup>0</sup> = 2, so the statement means there are 2 (base 10) types of people.</p>

<p>Can you describe the weather? If you take this question literally, the answer is &ldquo;yes.&rdquo; If you read into it, your answer will describe the weather.</p>
