      <p>Yesterday I heard a commercial for Time Warner Cable. They were advertising their cable/Internet bundles and named a price only to add a caveat that this price was for new subscribers only. This comes after I get a letter detailing Time Warner&rsquo;s impending price hike. It would feel great to exclaim, &ldquo;I like Time Warner! They&rsquo;ve treated me right and kept my rates fair.&rdquo; Instead, I say, &ldquo;I chose Time Warner because I don&rsquo;t have any other real options and their introductory rate was competitive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This is just one example. We&rsquo;ve created a culture of &ldquo;abandon ship&rdquo; instead of long-term brand relationships. Why don&rsquo;t companies use loyalty rates instead of special introductory pricing? Now, as I  look for new service providers, I am wooed by long-term savings rather than asterisk riddled short-term deals.</p>

<p>I sense that the pendulum is swinging and companies with outstanding customer support will prosper. As that happens, I hope consumers are rewarded for picking a company and sticking with them. Props to insurance and car companies for being some of the first to adopt this model.</p>

      <p>People spend a lot of time in their cars and we currently have to adapt to the car rather than have the car adapt to us. Why don&rsquo;t cars move to configurable heads up displays? When I drive, I have to move my focus from the road to the speedometer, mirrors, and fuel gauge. This information could be made more usable, which would increase safety and improve the user experience.</p>

<p>Gamers are comfortable with heads up displays. The user interface has data that players are used to seeing. For a first person shooter (FPS), for example, you will see health, a map, the weapon and armor left. In a sports game, you see the score, the time remaining, etc. Modern games allow users to configure the interface as they choose and people eat it up. Browsers are now doing similar things with addons/extensions. If you don&rsquo;t like the look and feel of the places where you spend time, you can change them. Cars should do the same.</p>

<p>In my case, I&rsquo;d like a digital speedometer and compass superimposed  in my field of view. I don&rsquo;t need to see fuel levels, temperatures, or anything else unless there&rsquo;s an error so blank those while driving. I&rsquo;d also love a mini-display of the cars around me. The car could use sensors to find other obstacles and provide a map&mdash;no more blind spot!</p>

<p>The only similar idea I&rsquo;ve heard of is factory customization for the Scion. You could choose any five of the thirty options (different wheels, floor mats, improved stereo, paint job, etc.). Where&rsquo;s the end-user programming for vehicles?</p>

<p>A simple roadmap to success: make all the gauges digital then allow users to configure how and where they are displayed.</p>

<p>Sound good? Would you buy a car that you could customize more? Isn&rsquo;t software great? :)</p>

      <p>Humans spend a lot of time in the bathroom. Not all the time is spent on bodily functions, but I think &ldquo;poddying&rdquo; is generally a waste of time&mdash;a human weakness! Is there any research on how to eliminate waste in the human body? For example, instead of creating urine you might be able burn up (metabolize) excess fluid. Urination expels waste, but sweat does too; that leads me to believe there are natural alternatives available (like a drug to route excess water to the skin instead of the bladder). Even solid wastes might be expelled in a more comfortable, scheduled way. If commercials are any indication, a large segment of the population regularly experiences discomfort associated with bodily functions, so this seems like a natural path for research: put people in control of their own body!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not a biologist and this is  not at all my field, so I&rsquo;d love to hear if I have missed any potential research or misunderstood the human machine.</p>

      <p>Ever woken up uncomfortably hot or cold? Maybe you wake up sweaty in the mornings? Why don&rsquo;t we embed intelligence into bedding to keep people at an ideal sleep temperature? Using thermometers, moisture sensors, and/or light sensors (wet skin reflects differently) you could easily determine an occupant&rsquo;s temperature and adjust accordingly. The adjustments are more tricky, I think. Perhaps you could raise the covers if people are too warm and tighten them if they&rsquo;re too cold; or have heating and cooling elements in the bed; or control airflow over the bed.</p>

<p>Does this exist? If not, why not?! Are there better ways to detect the person&rsquo;s temperature and adjust accordingly?</p>

<p>I believe that January 2011 should come after December 2010. Whoops! I guess amid the massive innovation, this corner case slipped through.</p>

<p>In any case, happy birthday to Dean and Steve :)</p>

      <p>This morning my cat jumped on the bed, walked up to me, plopped down on my head, and started purring. This morning ritual can be annoying, but I appreciate how open with his feelings the cat is. When he likes something, he purrs; when he doesn&rsquo;t, he runs off. With the holiday season upon us, I think this is a great way to live: show whenever you like something, and if you&rsquo;re unhappy then walk away.</p>

<p>Happy holidays everyone! Be like a cat and enjoy life your way :)</p>

      <p>Everyday, millions of people fly. I&rsquo;d guess most everyone hates the process. As with most things in life, happy people make everything better (they&rsquo;re more productive, etc)&mdash;and it&rsquo;s contagious!</p>

<p>Terminals</p>

<ul>
<li>Better seating</li>
<li>More A/C outlets</li>
<li>Free wifi</li>
<li>Smoking rooms</li>
</ul>


<p>Flights</p>

<ul>
<li>Allow people to use electronic devices the whole time</li>
<li>Turn on the entertainment system and A/C before passengers board and leave them on until people are off the plane</li>
<li>USB charging stations on each seat</li>
<li>Assigned overhead bins</li>
<li>Some sane amount of free alcohol (maybe 1 drink per 4 hours)</li>
<li>A light snack (research points to about 300 calories per 3 hours)</li>
<li>Treat people like adults!</li>
</ul>


<p>There are some other ideas in <a title="Salon" href="http://www.salon.com/technology/ask_the_pilot/2010/09/15/airplane_seating/index.html" target="_blank">this article on Salon</a>.</p>

<p>Beyond these, improved communication and more travel options would be fantastic. What would you like to see?</p>

      <p>This morning I received an email titled</p>

<blockquote>
<h1>Lane added you to the group &#8220;Close Friends and Family.&#8221;</h1>

<p>Followed shortly thereafter by this one:</p>

<blockquote>
<h1>Lane Holloway changed the name of the group &#8220;Close Friends and Family&#8221; to &#8220;Friends and Family&#8221;.</h1>
</blockquote>


<p>Opening the emails reveals a link to Facebook. When I asked my brother, he said he had no idea it would email people. Good thing he did not make a group for people he does not like&hellip;</p>

<p><a title="Facebook Blog: Groups" href="http://www.facebook.com/blog.php?post=434700832130" target="_blank">The idea behind</a> <a title="Facebook Groups" href="http://www.facebook.com/groups/" target="_blank">Facebook Groups</a> is good: organize your connections and filter the appropriate information to them; however, I do not like that others would know what group they are in&mdash;informing people is a user&rsquo;s choice. By informing people that they won&rsquo;t receive all your updates, you defeat the purpose of selective correspondence. For example, &ldquo;Oh, Seth put me in group &lsquo;no updates for you&rsquo;&hellip; I thought he just didn&rsquo;t use facebook <em>cry</em>&rdquo; That&rsquo;s, of course, a made up example. I love everyone :)</p>

      <p>I&rsquo;m extremely proud of my wife, Andrea, as she started <a title="McGregor Holloway" href="http://www.mcgregorholloway.com/" target="_blank">McGregor Holloway</a> with her friend, Dr. Alison McGregor. Both have taught English overseas and helped local students and professionals with their communication skills, so it&rsquo;s a great pairing.</p>

<p>What are language services? Andrea&rsquo;s favorite term is &ldquo;accent modification&rdquo; but other people call it various things such as</p>

<ul>
<li>changing your accent</li>
<li><a title="Wikipedia: Accent Reduction" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accent_reduction" target="_blank">accent reduction</a></li>
<li>elocution</li>
<li>speech instruction</li>
<li>voice improvement</li>
<li>learning English</li>
<li>English pronounciation</li>
<li>cultural studies</li>
<li>acting more American</li>
<li>speaking or talking like an American</li>
</ul>


<p>Andrea and Alison have some really neat ideas for how to help people! For now, they can support people (students and technology professionals, so far) in the Austin area. I&rsquo;m a firm believer in the power of communication skills, so I encourage anyone who has problems being understood to contact them.</p>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/on-the-usability-of-my-old-samsung-cell-phone/">On the usability of my old Samsung cell phone</a></h1>
      <p>For years, I lived without a smart phone. (Looking back, I&rsquo;m not sure I was truly living, but it was something resembling life.) My little Samsung phone had great battery life, clear call quality, and it fit nicely in my pocket. The phone never failed me when calling or texting (although I don&rsquo;t care for T9). Overall, great usability! For all its good, however, the alarm was really funky! I&rsquo;m not sure how the interactions developed. Let me illustrate with a few examples:</p>

<ul>
<li>Once, while traveling overseas the alarm went off despite the phone being powered off. After that, I made sure alarms were inactive before I turned off the phone.</li>
<li>If the alarm went off and you pressed the volume up button on the side of the phone, the alarm was snoozed; however, if you pressed the volume down button, the alarm was canceled. Neat that you could control the alarm without opening the phone! But the buttons are small to begin with and they&rsquo;re adjacent to one another so it is very hard to hit the proper one.  I used the alarm for  appointments as well as my primary wake-up call. Many mornings I fumbled in the dark to grab my phone; in the process I would hit the mute button. If I was really tired, this meant I slept undisturbed for an extra couple hours. Whoops.</li>
<li>You could not snooze or accept the alarm by opening the phone while it was going off. Near as I could figure, opening the phone while the alarm rang was equivalent to snoozing. Instead, you had to go into the alarm menu, toggle the alarm on then off. This reveals another odd feature:</li>
<li>There were only two states: on and off. Snoozing the alarm would show the alarm as off, yet it would continue to buzz periodically. Confusing!</li>
</ul>


<p>So how would I fix it? A couple simple things: the alarm should properly convey the three possible states: on, snooze, off. A bell icon in addition to off could take the place of a more explicit &ldquo;SNOOZE&rdquo; state, but the information should be present. Next, make both external buttons snooze. Now, a user can quiet the alarm or give themself an extra few minutes sleep. Once you open the phone, you can tell what state the alarm is in and take the proper action. Et viola!</p>
