      <p>Last semester I received an energetic email about offering UT students one-on-one interaction with local software professionals. At first, I did not understand the vision (sorry Sukant!), but I felt it was worth pursuing so I replied. After a couple emails I was on-board and ready to help out with the noble vision. Basically, students graduate with a lot of skills, but they still have a lot left to learn before they&rsquo;re truly effective in industry. Why don&rsquo;t we augment the curriculum and arm students with the skills they need while they&rsquo;re still in school? From this simple idea, <a title="Austin Software Mentorship" href="http://groups.google.com/group/atx-sw-mentors" target="_blank">Austin Software Mentorship</a> was born. It&rsquo;s a really cool group and I&rsquo;m proud of where it&rsquo;s going! I&rsquo;ve met a lot of incredible local people and been humbled and impressed by their range of skills. I have a lot to learn :)</p>

<p>So why am I am posting? To announce the first major event!</p>

<blockquote><em>What</em>: Professional-grade classwork: How software professionals might code your homework and projects

<em>Where</em>: TAY 3.128

<em>When</em>: 7pm Thursday, February 11th

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>More Information</em></span>
PROFESSIONAL-GRADE CLASSWORK
How software professionals might code your homework and projects

Local software professionals will introduce concepts, techniques, and tools
essential to software development in industry.  Students in a software
discipline are encouraged to work these practices into their software
classwork.

Pizza and beverages will be provided.</blockquote>


<p>I encourage any student or software professional to join the mailing list and get involved; I promise you won&rsquo;t be disappointed.</p>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/scattergories-style-grading-a-solution-to-obvious-homework-solutions/">Scattergories style grading: a solution to obvious homework solutions</a></h1>
      <p>This week I read an interesting article about <a title="Homework and the Internet" href="http://jsaia.wordpress.com/2010/01/29/homework-and-the-internet/" target="_blank">homework and the Internet</a> (shared by <a title="Lucas Wiman" href="http://www.google.com/profiles/lucas.wiman" target="_blank">Lucas Wiman</a>). The gist is that the Internet has trivialized homework  because students can find answers for virtually everything online. Rather than spend their time thinking about the solution, they Google for similar problems and copy the work. I found this to be largely true last semester when I TA&rsquo;d a course on project management&ndash;note: I am not implying that the students cheated! Read on! Whenever students asked for help, I referred to the book then Googled for additional hints. In my searches, I inevitably found the answer or very helpful related information.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s true that not all solutions are available online, nor are all questions conducive to Googling, but enough are that it has changed teaching. To discourage rote copying, I propose a simple tweak to grading: award credit only to unique answers&ndash;basically, like <a title="Wikipedia: Scattergories" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scattergories" target="_blank">Scattergories</a>.</p>

<p>Now, giving 100% credit based on originality is probably a little harsh, but 25% for a unique solution seems fair. Suddenly students have two options: 1) copy the answer from the web and receive now better than a  75/100, or 2) use their creativity to arrive at their own solution and receive full credit. Even if students choose a mix of personalizing the web solution, the learning objectives will be met because they have to think more deeply to understand the problem and update the solution in a unique (yet still correct) way.</p>

<p>What do you think? Original answers only ;-)</p>

      <p>My sister received her PhD last Spring. She completed the highest level of schooling in a difficult field at one of the top 10 best institutions in the world. Wow! That&rsquo;s awesome by anyone&rsquo;s metrics! Yet, at the terminal degree graduation ceremony (that packed a college basketball arena) attendees were completely civilized (quiet). As Allison strode across the stage I let out a loud whoop! of approval and felt eyes on me for my social outburst.</p>

<p>Months later, this still bothers me. Why don&rsquo;t we (civilized Americans) cheer loudly when people accomplish big things? I&rsquo;m not sure any amount of noise could truly capture the the effort Allison put in and pride that we all felt, but that shouldn&rsquo;t stop us from whooping and hollaring with merriment.</p>

<p>The next time someone you love accomplishes something big, celebrate loud and proud!</p>

      <p>Yesterday afternoon I proposed my work, &ldquo;Simplifying the Programming of Intelligent Environments.&rdquo; I passed with a few good suggestions but no major revisions required; I&rsquo;m told the outcome is about as good as it gets, however, I hope this is not how &ldquo;as good as it gets&rdquo; feels. I&rsquo;m officially ABD (all but dissertation), so the fun begins!</p>

<p>Thanks to everyone who supported me in-person and in-spirit! I&rsquo;m very lucky to have so many great people in my life.</p>

      <p>I sent an email to the <a title="Students in Software Engineering @ UT" href="http://www.edge.utexas.edu/sse/" target="_blank">Students in Software Engineering</a>, but I&rsquo;d like to cover my bases and make the announcement public. It is rather unorthodox to invite everyone to a proposal, but I&rsquo;m doing great work and I&rsquo;m ready to spread the word!</p>

<p>You are invited to my Ph.D. qualifying exam on Tuesday, November 10 at 2pm in ENS 637. If you are considering a PhD, I encourage you to come and learn the process! The talk should also be entertaining for those of you interested in intelligent environments (e.g., smart homes). These presentations generally last one hour.</p>

<p>Please do not feel obligated to come; if you can make it and you&rsquo;re interested, you are welcome.</p>

      <p>Recently, my ever-helpful labmate, <a title="Drew Stovall is thoroughly awesome" href="http://dstovall.com" target="_blank">Dr. Drew Stovall</a>, suggested the call for papers wiki, or <a title="Wiki Call for Papers (wikicfp)" href="http://www.wikicfp.com/cfp/home" target="_blank">wikicfp.com</a>. The site is well done: easy to navigate, intuitive, open, and free. Basically, you subscribe to the conferences you&rsquo;re interested in, then the site will email you approaching deadlines. They also offer an amazing calendar view so you can plan your <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">vacation</span> submissions.</p>

<p>As I prepare to propose and begin the sprint to the finish, I was reviewing target deadlines on the site. I noticed that a conference <a title="Andy Ko: Interview by Emerson Murphy-Hill" href="http://andyjko.com/2009/10/01/emerson-interview-part-2-writing-for-hci-venues/" target="_blank">recommended by one of my favorite researchers</a>, <a title="Dr. Andy Ko @ DUB" href="http://faculty.washington.edu/ajko/" target="_blank">Dr. Andy Ko</a> was not on the site. In about two minutes I was able to add the <a title="VL/HCC 2010" href="http://dei.inf.uc3m.es/vlhcc10/index.html" target="_blank"><em><span>IEEE Symposium on  Visual Languages and Human-Centric Computing 2010</span></em></a><span>,</span> not only to my own list, but to the site as a whole. N<span>ow, other HCI aficionados can sign stay abreast of the conference . See the CFP <a title="WikiCFP: VL/HCC 2010" href="http://www.wikicfp.com/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=6990" target="_blank">here</a>. There&rsquo;s probably a slant towards technical fields, which is to be expected because technical people are most likely to use a tool like this; however, the platform is incredibly powerful and open-ended, so I hope everyone uses the site.</span></p>

<p><span>I hope this is helpful for other paper-writers. </span><span>Are there other cool tools I&rsquo;m missing? I&rsquo;d love to find out how to do my job more efficiently, so please share!

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/fixie-the-black-sheep-of-bikes/">Fixie: The Black Sheep of Bikes</a></h1>
      <p>After I started riding my bike more often, I got interested in bike culture. I&rsquo;ve talked to seasoned UT cyclists learning best routes, safety tips, how to maintain a bike, how to stay warm/cool, etc. One of my favorite topics has been the fixie. The fixie, or <a title="Wikipedia: Fixed-gear Bicycle" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-gear_bicycle" target="_blank">fixed-gear bicycle</a> is something of an anomaly. Fixies do not have &ldquo;speeds&rdquo; like the ubiquitous childhood 10-speed; instead, fixies are single-speed bikes that directly tie pedal rotations to tire rotations. If your tires are moving, so are your pedals. So much for coasting!  Most fixies do not have brakes&ndash;not even <a title="Wikipedia: Coaster Brakes" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle_brake_systems#Coaster_brakes" target="_blank">coaster brakes</a> like your old BMX bike! A fixie rider has to stop the bike by resisting the pedals. By avoiding modern technology, fixies are the black sheep of bikes.</p>

<p>Below is a picture of a typical fixie. There are a few things to notice</p>

<ul>
<li>the lack of gears and a tight chain</li>
<li>the colored wheels</li>
<li>the thin, custom handlebars</li>
<li>somewhat flashy, although aesthetically pleasing</li>
</ul>


<p><a href="http://www.tonicfab.com/uploaded_images/blk_fixie_7-794097.jpg"><img title="A typical fixie" src="http://www.tonicfab.com/uploaded_images/blk_fixie_7-794097.jpg" alt="A typical fixie" width="400" height="346" /></a></p>

<p>Please see Wired&rsquo;s article on five <a title="Wired.com: 5 inexplicable fixie trends" href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2009/04/five-inexplicab/" target="_blank">inexplicable fixie trends</a> for more ways to identify a fixie.</p>

<p>Fixies seems to have risen to prominence in New York City where crazy bicycle messengers would deftly maneuver through traffic en route to deliveries. Other big cities followed suit and a cult of cool was spawned: if you didn&rsquo;t ride a fixie, you weren&rsquo;t hardcore.</p>

<p>Fixed-gear cycling is said to be the most intense experience one can have with the road, and the bicycle is incredibly easy to maintain because it is so simple. Opponents point out that this style of riding is hard on the body, particularly the knees, and generally dumb because 1) brakes are incredibly useful, especially in the city, and 2) gears are incredibly useful, especially in a hilly city where speed and effort need to be modulated quickly.</p>

<p>You see quite a few fixies in Austin, generally ridden by hipsters. I&rsquo;ll unscientifically say they&rsquo;re &frac14; bikes I see ridden (while the absolute number of fixed-gear bicycles is small, fixie riders use their bikes a lot so you see more of them as a percentage). Originally, I thought the fixed-gear bicycle was just a fad, but the ridership is still strong.</p>

<p>In case you&rsquo;re wondering why anyone would ever ride a fixie, here are a few videos that demonstrate the true power of fixies (hint: none of these videos take place on <a title="6street.com: Guadalupe" href="http://www.6street.com/6s_pg_guadalupe.htm" target="_blank">the drag</a>):</p>

<object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="425" height="344" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/76hg3ss7gQE&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="344" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/76hg3ss7gQE&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object>


<p>Or the more graceful, feminine bicycle ballerinas: <a title="YouTube: Bicycle Ballerinas" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48C_KHwt53c" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48C_KHwt53c">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48C_KHwt53c</a></a> and the bicycle ballerina: <a title="YouTube.com: Bicycle Ballerina" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxV1X5EzfCA" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxV1X5EzfCA">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxV1X5EzfCA</a></a></p>

<p>What do you think? Would you ride a fixie? Do you already? Are they a good-for-nothing trend or the ultimate bike experience? Perhaps both?</p>

<p>If you do not have a friend who will tell you that you have something in your teeth, get one. If you will not return the courtesy to your good friends, change! Life is greatly enriched by deep social interactions.</p>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/public-transport-technology-good/">Public Transport + Technology = Good</a></h1>
      <p>Why don&rsquo;t public transportation providers outfit their vehicles with GPS trackers and update the position in real time? This would effectively eliminate the need for time tables: just check the website/phone application to see when a bus will be near you. Traffic? No problem! The map still shows exactly where the bus is. Even the bus-drivers could use the map to coordinate with other bus-drivers on their route.</p>

<p>Extending this system, the bus could text individuals whenever it is <em>X</em> minutes from a <em>bus-stop</em> (where the user sets the <em>X</em> and the <em>bus-stop</em>). I have a bus stop two minutes from my front door, so the morning bus would text me when it was five minutes away; similarly, at school I&rsquo;m about 10 minutes from the bus stop so I would want a text about 15 minutes in advance. That&rsquo;s better living through software! And the technology exists already.</p>

<p>From an economics standpoint, this innovation would be justified if ridership would increase enough to offset the cost of the project (hardware, software, installation. and maintenance). My hunch is that this system would pay itself off quickly because more people would ride the bus if it were easier to catch. Who wants to wait in the rain or the sweltering heat indefinitely? A system like this would also differentiate the transportation operator and raise the bar on service. I rode a bullet train, in part, because I wanted to experience the future. I can just imagine Austinintes on vacation bragging, &ldquo;CapMetro back in Austin texts you whenever the bus is close! Why doesn&rsquo;t this city do the same?&rdquo;</p>

<p>So, how about it? Why doesn&rsquo;t your city make public transportation easier? What other innovations and upgrades should we expect from public transportation?</p>
