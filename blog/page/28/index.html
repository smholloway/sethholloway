      <p>It&rsquo;s always exciting to read sci-fi novels and discover what the future could look like. Sci-fi movies show it even more vividly. Minority Report has a futuristic gesture-based user interface that looks cool, but I&rsquo;m not sure I would use it well :)</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of space between the Minority Report style and our current interfaces. Research will get us there one day, but in the meantime I would love a user interface where I could simultaneously view arbitrarily many modules (web pages, documents, games, etc.) or submodules (pieces of those things). Each (sub)module could be closed, moved, and resized: think ofÂ  iPhone-like controls on all your browser tabs. Windows Alt-Tab preview as well as browsers tab previews are a step in the right direction, but you ultimately choose only one module at a time. Mashups  (iGoogle for example) offered are a promising path to achieving this, but I still have not seen dynamically-sized, dynamically-loaded, swappable modules.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve got the technology, please let me know. If not, create it and send me a link to buy it!</p>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/update-customer-service-debacles/">**UPDATE** Customer service debacles</a></h1>
      <p>I have felt a general <a title="Please your customers!" href="http://sethholloway.com/blog/?p=444" target="_blank">lack of love from companies recently</a>. Last night, after 7 hours of calling Japan Airlines and Vayama, I got a full refund on my now-cancelled honeymoon to Thailand. For those keeping track, I&rsquo;m two for two on my customer service battles. I&rsquo;m overjoyed at the outcome, but I remain greatly frustrated by the experience.</p>

<p>This morning I was thinking about truly pleasing customer service experiences. Sadly, the only one I thought of was a trip to <a title="Whataburger" href="http://whataburger.com/" target="_blank">Whataburger</a> where they charged me for two meals when I only ordered one. I told the employee the situation and she immediately swiped my card and refunded me the $5 with no questions asked and no excuses. Needless to say, I love <a title="Whataburger commercial" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiSqEadjYhk" target="_blank">Whataburger</a> and continue to destroy their #11 breakfast combo (in moderation) :)</p>

<p>Reflecting now I wonder 1) Have I really had so few positive customer service experiences? 2) Why can Whataburger help me immediately when other companies can&rsquo;t or won&rsquo;t? 3) Is service better in a culture where tradition and the greater good are important (i.e. Asia)?</p>

<p>Anyone else have experiences (positive or negative) they want to share?</p>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/pleasing-customers-do-it/">Pleasing customers (DO IT)</a></h1>
      <p>I&rsquo;m not sure if it&rsquo;s the economy or just bad luck, but my customer service experiences recently have been awful. Earlier this month <a title="Seth Holloway Dot Com" href="http://sethholloway.com/blog/?p=345" target="_blank">I was battling with World of Warcraft customer service</a> after a time zone mismatch ruined my fun. After several phone calls and over ten emails, the situation has been resolved&mdash;not fixed, resolved. They compensated me nicely, but ultimately they could not right the wrong. Overall, I am satisfied and will continue doing business with them. Unfortunately, it took far too long for me to be satisfied.</p>

<p>Now, a much more serious matter has come to light: Thailand, our a long-awaited December vacation destination, <a title="Google News" href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gXtkIJGFlHXR5qT3LIG2olEVZyFQD94MV9780" target="_blank">has experienced a wave of protests that shut down international airports</a>. The non-violent protests forced Prime Minister Somchai Wongsawat out of power and led to huge headaches for foreigners in (or trying to get to) Thailand. The climate is not right for foreign travelers; <a title="JAL press release" href="http://www.ar.jal.com/cms/contents/en/special_news_107.html" target="_blank">Japan Airlines even stopped flights</a> and the US State Department <a title="official site" href="http://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/pa/pa_1998.html" target="_blank">recommended that Americans defer trips</a>.</p>

<p>So what&rsquo;s the problem? Vayama (a company I won&rsquo;t even link because they have not earned it) will not refund our tickets despite the instability of the region and recent travel stoppages. They have done everything to frustrate me and waste my time without ever leaving me pleased. The first pass automated systems cannot answer my question, so I navigate confusing menus and deal with long waits before reaching a human. Finally, the human on the other end cannot help. A little good will goes a long way. Right now I do not plan to use Vayama again; the money they&rsquo;ve made off me now pales in comparison to the potential earnings if they had made a good impression.</p>

<p>Sadly, I&rsquo;ve encountered this workflow twice in a few weeks and it is all wrong. If you want to succeed in business, do the exact opposite of this. Customer service should have pleasing customers as a general goal. I understand this may cost more, but the funny thing about customers is that you want them and you won&rsquo;t get that when your representatives run all customers off.</p>

<p>Two of my favorite bloggers, <a title="Seth Godin" href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/" target="_blank">Seth Godin</a> and <a title="Joel On Software" href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/" target="_blank">Joel Spolsky</a>, have commented on the simple act of pleasing customers and the big impact it has. See <a title="Joel on Software: Excellent Customer Service" href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/customerservice.html" target="_blank">Joel&rsquo;s take on customer service</a> and <a title="Google search of Seth Godin's site" href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;domains=http%3A%2F%2Fsethgodin.typepad.com%2F&amp;sitesearch=http%3A%2F%2Fsethgodin.typepad.com%2F&amp;q=customer+service+site%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fsethgodin.typepad.com%2F&amp;btnG=Search&amp;sitesearch=http%3A%2F%2Fsethgodin.typepad.com%2F" target="_blank">Seth&rsquo;s many posts</a>, especially <a title="Seth Godin Apologies Ranked" href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2007/02/apologies_ranke.html" target="_blank">apologies and what they mean</a> and the <a title="Seth Godin Creating a Clearance Culture" href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2008/11/creating-a-clea.html" target="_blank">clearance culture</a>.</p>

<p>My desperate plea to employers is really quite simple:</p>

<ul>
<li>Empower entry level customer service representatives to solve problems&mdash;they are the ones making an impression</li>
<li>Give customer service representatives  respect&mdash;they drive as many sales as the marketing department</li>
<li>Pay customer service representatives fairly&mdash;this may require hiring people of a worthy caliber</li>
<li>Offer customer service representatives a career path&mdash;again, you may have to be awake while hiring</li>
<li>Reduce the overhead in communications&mdash;reduce wait times, shorten telephone spiels, etc.</li>
<li>Go out of your way to thank and appreciate customers&mdash;your business does not exist without them!</li>
</ul>

      <p>As I perfect my PhD workflow I&rsquo;m learning a lot. I&rsquo;ve gotten much more efficient at finding related work and target conferences; I&rsquo;ve improved my writing and organizational skills; I&rsquo;ve found a number of tools that make my life easier (for example I use Google Docs to track references and write drafts so that I can view them from any Internet-connected computer). However, now I&rsquo;m at the point where I know my topic and I need to stay current on the research. From what I can tell, most academics do this by reading the program from conferences related to their work. That&rsquo;s fine as a backup, but there&rsquo;s got to be an easier way! Why not automate the delivery of related articles or entire conference proceedings?</p>

<p>As a dedicated RSS fan (RSS feeds are a great way to keep up with the latest news!) I would love to subscribe to my 10 conferences and have them publish to my reader as soon as the proceedings are available. However, IEEE and ACM do not publish papers or articles via RSS! I understand conferences are big money makers so you may want to make people pay for the content, but I get emails and magazines from IEEE that I could receive instead as an RSS feed. Groups that represent the height of technological research are 10 years behind the times!</p>

<p>Thanks to blogs, twitter, facebook, and the raft of immediate media, everyone is a publisher. IEEE and ACM seem to be following the print newspaper style which is not 1) economically feasible or 2) good for spreading your brand. Don&rsquo;t try to horde content in hopes of making more money. I get more interesting research from Wired than I do from IEEE because IEEE withholds the work. (That&rsquo;s hyperbole of course&mdash;my job is to cruise for papers and UT has an amazing infrastructure in place for doing so&mdash;however, Wired does make it much easier to find interesting technology).</p>

<p>Until I find another way, I plan on setting up Google alerts (sent to my RSS reader) to notify me of conference proceedings and/or make related work searches into RSS feeds (i.e. get a notification when a new rolling alarm clock is discussed). Does anyone else see the irony in all this? Has anyone found an easier way to stay up to date with research in your area?</p>
