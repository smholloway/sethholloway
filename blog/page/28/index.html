      <p>In these tough economic times we&rsquo;ve heard about companies laying off employees and closing. The news has been so frequent that I&rsquo;m already somewhat desensitized; however, there are some angles that I had not considered. Case in point, gift cards to companies going out of business are now use-it-or-lose-it. Andrea and I got several gift cards for the wedding and I generally get gift cards for Xmas and birthday, so I have a few saved up. Here&rsquo;s a list of companies that are in trouble, so look to spend those certificates!</p>

      <p>Here&rsquo;s another hilarious internet video that makes you feel bad for laughing. A poor chap blocks a fierce throw-in with his face while the crowd simultaneously winces. Moral of the story: do not put your face in front of a fast-moving soccer ball.</p>

<p>I did not recognize the move (which isn&rsquo;t saying much) so I googled some and discovered the flip throw-in. Here&rsquo;s a <a title="eHow to flip throw in" href="http://www.ehow.com/how_5259_flip-throw-soccer.html" target="_blank">how-to</a> if you&rsquo;re interested.</p>

<p>Has anyone ever seen this done in real life? It just seems over-the-top like a rainbow kick&hellip;</p>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/world-of-warcraft-customer-service-sucks/">World of Warcraft customer service sucks</a></h1>
      <p>I play World of Warcraft (WoW). I have played off and on since the game was released four years ago. Now the folks at Blizzard have released a second expansion, Wrath of the Lich King (WotLK). Prior to WotLK&rsquo;s release, Blizzard started a promotion called Recruit a Friend (RaF). RaF allows a veter to recruit a friend and play together with a number of benefits. The key benefit, in my opinion, was the ability for the friend to grant levels to the veteran essentially keeping both characters at the same level so they can continue to adventure together.</p>

<p>The deal hit after I had quit, so a friend of mine referred me and we played. You can see that I created the account on August 5th.</p>

<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-347" title="The official site shows the account was created August 5" src="/images/account_created.jpg" alt="The official site shows the account was created August 5" width="150" height="40" /></p>

<p>On November 3, the last night of our account link (which ran through 11-4-08 as seen below), I had several levels to grant to Jason.</p>

<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-346" title="The official site shows accounts are linked until Nov 4" src="/images/accounts_linked_until_1-300x69.jpg" alt="The official site shows accounts are linked until Nov 4" width="300" height="69" /></p>

<p>We met up and found that we were no longer linked. We both opened a help request in game. After four hours a game master (GM) showed up to Jason and was pretty professional. I got a sassy son of a bitch who closed the help ticket while I was talking to him. Eventually Jason was told to contact billing because there was nothing more the GM could do for him.</p>

<p>The next day Jason called billing and found out that our accounts were linked for exactly 90 days and the time displayed on the website was only an estimate.</p>

<p>To add insult to injury, the ultimate resolution was three free days of play-time. No level grants, no honoring the contract, just three days play-time and a lot of disingenuous apologetic hogwash. Bah!</p>

      <p>A lot of people I know use Macs. And a lot of people who don&rsquo;t use Macs want to. The Apple ads are brilliant! No, I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re entertaining or funny, but they are effective in converting PC users to Apple fanboys. Looking past the ads and into the hardware, we see a fairly standard machine. The software is what really sets Macs apart&mdash;OS X is pretty and easy to use. It is truly amazing that Macs can simultaneously support technogeeks (for example with a powerful command line) and the computer-illiterate. As they say about Macs, &ldquo;they just work.&rdquo; So well in fact that even musicians can use them :)</p>

<p>So why don&rsquo;t I have a Mac? Because they&rsquo;re extremely expensive. As I said, the hardware is nothing special, in fact, they now use standard Intel parts! That means the operating system adds an additional $1000 to the computer, and you can&rsquo;t get the OS without buying a Mac. Until now!</p>

<p>As soons as Mac started using Intel hardware, people started <a title="Hackintosh on Lifehacker" href="http://lifehacker.com/software/hack-attack/build-a-hackintosh-mac-for-under-800-321913.php" target="_blank">hacking the hardware/software to allow generic machines to run OS X</a>. These PCs-gone-Mac are cleverly titled Hackintosh. Hackintosh machines have come a long way! As more and more people try it out, the product will evolve and improve to where anyone can have their own Mac on the cheap.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure what Apple&rsquo;s strategy is, but I&rsquo;d like to find out what the real back room talk is. It seems that selling the OS separately is worthwhile, especially when people are already distributing it.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s it worth to you? $800 for a hackintosh or $1400+ for a MacBook?</p>

      <p>Because college <a title="seth holloway dot com college football is big business" href="http://sethholloway.com/blog/?p=331" target="_blank">football is big business</a>, it is big news that UT Defensive Coordinator <a title="wikipedia Will Muschamp" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Muschamp" target="_blank">Will Muschamp</a> is next in line for <a title="Daily Texan" href="http://www.dailytexanonline.com/football_muschamp_seals_future_in_texas" target="_blank">head coach at UT</a>. This is good news because it shows that Texas football will promote high achieving individuals, and Muschamp is a talented spitfire.</p>

<p>I predict that <a title="Mack Brown" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mack_Brown" target="_blank">Mack Brown</a> and <a title="Colt McCoy" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colt_McCoy" target="_blank">Colt McCoy</a> will stick around until next year when UT wins the national championship and Colt wins <a title="Heisman Trophy" href="http://www.heisman.com/" target="_blank">Heisman</a>. Mack will then step down and Muschamp will take over the championship team.</p>
