      <p><a title="Drs Julien blog" href="http://drsjulien.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Christine</a> had a very logical idea&hellip; post the <a title="mire holloway wedding pics pt 1" href="http://thenicholsblog.com/2008/07/08/andrea-seth/" target="_blank">wedding pictures</a> on the <a title="mire holloway wedding page" href="http://www.sethholloway.com/wedding.html" target="_blank">wedding website</a>. So, the link to our first round of wedding pics is now up there. We&rsquo;ve also been told that the full set should be available within the next week. You&rsquo;ll have a link as soon as I do! If anyone else has any good ideas, please let me know!</p>

      <p>Over the past six months I have been getting roughly one call per day from random 800 numbers from all over the country. The voice changes, but the message is always the same: &lsquo;This is the second notice that your car warranty is about to expire.&rsquo;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve spoken to other people who are also getting the calls. A friend of mine just bought a car and is receiving these ominous messages which cannot be true.</p>

<p>The worst part is that I&rsquo;m on the <a title="block phone spam" href="https://www.donotcall.gov/" target="_blank">National Do Not Call Registry</a> which should protect me from these unwanted phone calls. Does anyone know of a class action lawsuit against the filth behind these calls? Does anyone know how to file a class action lawsuit&hellip;</p>

<p>Edit: Thanks for pointing out the typo Jason :)</p>

      <p>I&rsquo;ve been impressed with movies recently. Sure, it&rsquo;s not cinematic gold nor radically different plotlines, but I&rsquo;ve been genuinely entertained. Andrea and I have been on a movie-a-week kick; here&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ve seen and I/we thought.</p>

<p>Wanted: entertaining. It may not be the most believable movie ever, but it was definitely entertaining. There are a number of movies with more plot holes and impossible physics much larger than this one. I applaud the studios for putting out something fresher and less predictable. Honestly, it&rsquo;s never a bad thing when a movie shows Angelie Jolie&rsquo;s backside :)</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t Mess with the Zohan: entertaining. We laughed a good portion of this movie. John Turturro is hilarious, as usual. This role cannot compete with The Jesus, but then again, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t fuck with the Jesus!&rdquo; This movie got a little preachy, but the message important: Jews and Muslims should stop fighting and get along. Sidenote: why are all the movies now trying to have a plot complete with a resolution? What happened to silly movies like Monty Python&rsquo;s Holy Grail that were hysterical movies thinly tied together? Thank you Jackass for being funny the entire time! God bless your stupidity for my amusement.</p>

<p>Hancock: entertaining. I felt somewhat betrayed by the previews, but the movie has some hilarious scenes while offering solid action, humor, and cutesy chick stuff ;) I actually expected a different ending, more mainstream ending, but (not give too much away) the current ending lends itself to sequels.</p>

<p>Independence Day at Master Pancake Theater: hilarious! The crew formerly known as Mister Sinus Theater never disappoints. Independence Day was trimmed from 2:20 to 1:45 and altered for increased hilarity. I did not remember the movie very well, so it was like watching a new movie.</p>

After all, this was the trip where we got engaged, and from the rest is history. The pictures are beautiful whether they are nearly a year old or not. Enjoy :)</p>

The wedding was a beautiful, small affair in the hills overlooking Lake Travis. I hope all the guests had a good time&mdash;I know I did! My apologies if I did not get a chance to talk to you, or if you were not invited (space was limited).</p>

<p>We just got back from a short honeymoon on Canyon Lake. Thanks to Justin at the <a title="the lakehouse bed and breakfast on canyon lake" href="http://www.thelakehousebb.com" target="_blank">Lakehouse Bed and Breakfast</a> for a wonderful stay. I highly recommend this destination if you want to get away from it all without traveling for hours or breaking the bank.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re now trying to organize everything, merge old and new items, and establish some semblance of normalcy.</p>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/the-happening/">The Happening</a></h1>
      <p>We saw The Happening last night, the movie&rsquo;s opening night. Given M. Night Shyamalan&rsquo;s body of work, I had no idea what to expect; I went in with an open mind. The movie was bad; it was ever so thinly veiled trite scare tactics about humanity&rsquo;s effect on the Earth. The actors did a great job, but the story was lacking. Several objects seemed to be important, but they never panned out. Examples include the mood ring, the child, the hot dogs, the old woman. Any one of the aforementioned items could have led to a more cohesive story. Basically, any other ending would have been an improvement. Here are some options I thought of:</p>

<p>1) Make it a love story &ndash; the main characters could have saved humanity with their pure intentions.</p>

<p>2) Make it a horror film &ndash; whew! Almost any change in plot would have made The Happening a horror film. I think the old woman controlling the destruction would have been a grand climax.</p>

<p>3) Make it a dream &ndash; the ultimate cop-out in endings; however, The Happening could have wiped away at least some of the bad if the entire scene took place in a dream.</p>

<p>I was most disappointed at the fact that the movie was shallow and unfinished. Documentaries are en vogue currently, and the objectives of this movie are better served with a factual production.</p>

<p>Better luck next time M Night Shyamalan!</p>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/fixing-american-health-care/">Fixing American Health Care</a></h1>
      <p>After watching Sicko I have been more interested in the American health care situation. I don&rsquo;t trust the government to provide high-quality health care coverage. Moore speaks highly of the English system, but a common perk for jobs in the UK (<a title="effects on Brits who choose private health care" href="http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/tax-advice/income-tax/article.html?in_article_id=408244&amp;in_page_id=77" target="_blank">private health care coverage</a>) suggests that the system is less than perfect. Benefits of America&rsquo;s quasi-privatized system are a wash: a person can receive care, but insurance rarely covers the entire cost of operations and medicine. There are a number of other issues at work (governmental regulations, the patent system, market competition, a lack of care for mentally-ill, &hellip;); however, my intent for this post is not to cover any of these complex issues, nor is it to enrage people or debate over the advantages and disadvantages of private health care. Instead, I simply want to share a solution that I find very clever and achievable: <a title="LetWalMartFixUSHealthCare" href="http://articles.moneycentral.msn.com/Investing/JubaksJournal/LetWalMartFixUSHealthCare.aspx" target="_blank">Let Wal-Mart Fix American Health Care</a>.</p>

<p>If they can roll back prices on so many everyday products, they should be able to hardball health care providers and pass the savings on to the consumers. I&rsquo;ll worship the Church of Wal-Mart if it saves me any of the $3,600 a year I pay for health care (for <a title="Andrea and myself" href="http://andrea.sethholloway.com" target="_blank">two</a>).</p>

      <p>What is the resolution of unaltered human sight? Computers are slowly pushing their capability higher: from 800x600 to 1920x1200 and beyond. I&rsquo;m left wondering &ldquo;When will the screen resolution catch our innate capabilities?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The answer is not simple and estimates differ on the resolution (<a title="acuity, resolution, ...what now?" href="http://www.clarkvision.com/imagedetail/eye-resolution.html" target="_blank">324 megapixel</a>, <a title="deviantart estimate of human resolution" href="http://news.deviantart.com/article/27174/" target="_blank">576 megapixels</a> to <a title="vision" href="http://www.swift.ac.uk/vision.pdf" target="_blank">15 million megapixels</a>). In any case, our eyes will outperform technology for at least another year or two :) That&rsquo;s when genetic engineering can save the day!</p>

The more you know, the more you realize you don&rsquo;t know! Definitely some interesting reads today&hellip;</p>

<p>There are some very interesting articles on economics of <a title="spooky ecnomics of technology" href="http://www.unionsquareventures.com/2008/06/the_spooky_econ.html">technology</a>, <a title="economics of growth" href="http://www.econlib.org/Library/Enc/EconomicGrowth.html" target="_blank">growth</a>, <a title="the economics of free" href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20070503/012939.shtml" target="_blank">free products</a>, and the <a title="who knew Vanity Fair did tech?" href="http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2008/07/internet200807" target="_blank">Internet</a>.</p>

<p>Hackers and evil-doers continue to innovate; <a title="1024 bit RSA encryption :'(" href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/security/?p=1251" target="_blank">ransomware</a> is now using advanced encryption.

A  number of groups are providing free kits for a variety of hacking tasks.
