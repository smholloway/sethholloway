      <p>I&rsquo;m a big fan of the Google suite of products. I&rsquo;ve been connecting via <a title="https on wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Https" target="_blank">https</a> for a while now, but Google has now made it easier. There&rsquo;s a <a title="Encrypt your Gmail!" href="http://www.webmonkey.com/blog/Why_You_Should_Turn_Gmail_s_SSL_Feature_On_Now" target="_blank">great article on Wired</a> about encrypting your Gmail. Anyone using the Google services should do this immediately. Here&rsquo;s a quick how-to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Log in to Gmail (<a title="GMAIL!" href="https://mail.google.com/mail/" target="_blank"><a href="https://mail.google.com/mail/">https://mail.google.com/mail/</a></a>)</li>
<li>In Gmail, click on &ldquo;Settings&rdquo; in the top right corner (beside your username).</li>
<li>Scroll to the &ldquo;Browser connection&rdquo; section at the bottom of the page</li>
<li>Click the radio button for &ldquo;Always use https&rdquo;</li>
<li>Click the &ldquo;Save changes: button at the bottom of the page</li>
<li>Profit</li>
</ul>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/riaa-a-fish-out-of-water/">RIAA: A fish out of water</a></h1>
      <p>The Digital Age is a confusing time for legislators who hardly figured out their own generation of technology. Unfortunately, luddites are making laws written by special interest groups who disagree with the majority of the public. For example, Senator Orrin Hatch suggested that software pirates have their computer automatically destroyed. (I can&rsquo;t imagine that one being exploited.) Turns out his <a title="orrin hatch, software pirate" href="http://www.wired.com/politics/law/news/2003/06/59305" target="_blank">official website is using code illegally</a>&mdash;kaboom! Meanwhile, Judge Kozinski who ruled that making songs available is the same thing as distributing them illegally <a title="Judge Kozinski, software pirate" href="http://blog.wired.com/27bstroke6/2008/06/judges-web-site.html" target="_blank">had mp3s and innappropriate pictures available on his personal machine</a>&mdash;&ldquo;that&rsquo;ll be $250,000 please&rdquo; signed the RIAA.</p>

<p>Sadly, two great online services are being shut down because of this archaic legislation. Pandora, an online radio that helps you find new artists is <a title="pandora could be shut down" href="http://blog.wired.com/music/2008/08/pandora-could-b.html" target="_blank">folding under the costs of royalties</a> that benefit only the record companies. And Muxtape, a site that let people create mix tapes is <a title="muxtape being shut down" href="http://techdirt.com/articles/20080818/2241092020.shtml" target="_blank">also being brought down</a>.</p>

<p>On a more positive note: A recent courtcase ended with the defendant agreeing to pay about <a title="techdirt coverage" href="http://techdirt.com/articles/20080818/1936552018.shtml" target="_blank">$750 per song she pirated</a>. $750 is significantly lower than the $250,000 possible and lower than what othersÂ  than average. The penalty is still unconstitutional. Ignorant offenders are being hit with fines that are over 1000 times more expensive than the item stolen&mdash;a song costs $0.99 from iTunes.</p>

<p>For more great information, I recommend the <a title="recording industry vs the people" href="http://recordingindustryvspeople.blogspot.com/">Recording Industry vs. The People blog</a>. It is a great resource for anyone who finds themselves under fire from the RIAA. The collection of materials on the <a title="RIAA's extortionate conduct" href="http://recordingindustryvspeople.blogspot.com/2008/05/collection-of-materials-on-riaa.html" target="_blank">RIAA&rsquo;s bully tactics</a> is infuriating while the <a title="open letter to colleges: don't comply with RIAA" href="http://recordingindustryvspeople.blogspot.com/2008/08/reprint-of-my-open-letter-to-colleges.html" target="_blank">open letter to colleges</a> is a refreshing ray of hope. While I was still an undergrad, UT did an excellent job of covering students who may or may not have been infringing (IP and MAC addresses can be faked, malware can be setup to pirate without your consent, etc). In the past couple years the RIAA has stepped up the enforcement and colleges are a prime target. Most universities are handing over documents and throwing their students under the bus.</p>

      <p><a title="Drs Julien blog" href="http://drsjulien.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Christine</a> had a very logical idea&hellip; post the <a title="mire holloway wedding pics pt 1" href="http://thenicholsblog.com/2008/07/08/andrea-seth/" target="_blank">wedding pictures</a> on the <a title="mire holloway wedding page" href="http://www.sethholloway.com/wedding.html" target="_blank">wedding website</a>. So, the link to our first round of wedding pics is now up there. We&rsquo;ve also been told that the full set should be available within the next week. You&rsquo;ll have a link as soon as I do!

      <p>Over the past six months I have been getting roughly one call per day from random 800 numbers from all over the country. The voice changes, but the message is always the same: &lsquo;This is the second notice that your car warranty is about to expire.&rsquo;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve spoken to other people who are also getting the calls. A friend of mine just bought a car and is receiving these ominous messages which cannot be true.</p>

<p>The worst part is that I&rsquo;m on the <a title="block phone spam" href="https://www.donotcall.gov/" target="_blank">National Do Not Call Registry</a> which should protect me from these unwanted phone calls. Does anyone know of a class action lawsuit against the filth behind these calls? Does anyone know how to file a class action lawsuit&hellip;</p>

<p>Edit: Thanks for pointing out the typo Jason :)</p>

      <p>I&rsquo;ve been impressed with movies recently. Sure, it&rsquo;s not cinematic gold nor radically different plotlines, but I&rsquo;ve been genuinely entertained. Andrea and I have been on a movie-a-week kick; here&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ve seen and I/we thought.</p>

<p>Wanted: entertaining. It may not be the most believable movie ever, but it was definitely entertaining. There are a number of movies with more plot holes and impossible physics much larger than this one. I applaud the studios for putting out something fresher and less predictable. Honestly, it&rsquo;s never a bad thing when a movie shows Angelie Jolie&rsquo;s backside :)</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t Mess with the Zohan: entertaining. We laughed a good portion of this movie. John Turturro is hilarious, as usual. This role cannot compete with The Jesus, but then again, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t fuck with the Jesus!&rdquo; This movie got a little preachy, but the message important: Jews and Muslims should stop fighting and get along. Sidenote: why are all the movies now trying to have a plot complete with a resolution? What happened to silly movies like Monty Python&rsquo;s Holy Grail that were hysterical movies thinly tied together? Thank you Jackass for being funny the entire time! God bless your stupidity for my amusement.</p>

<p>Hancock: entertaining. I felt somewhat betrayed by the previews, but the movie has some hilarious scenes while offering solid action, humor, and cutesy chick stuff ;) I actually expected a different ending, more mainstream ending, but (not give too much away) the current ending lends itself to sequels.</p>

<p>Independence Day at Master Pancake Theater: hilarious! The crew formerly known as Mister Sinus Theater never disappoints. Independence Day was trimmed from 2:20 to 1:45 and altered for increased hilarity. I did not remember the movie very well, so it was like watching a new movie.</p>

      <p>Australia pictures are now up! What&rsquo;s that? Sure, we were in Australia in November 2007, but we&rsquo;ve been busy! Hey. Hey! We&rsquo;ve been busy. After all, this was the trip where we got engaged, and from the rest is history. The pictures are beautiful whether they are nearly a year old or not. Enjoy :)</p>

The wedding was a beautiful, small affair in the hills overlooking Lake Travis. I hope all the guests had a good time&mdash;I know I did! My apologies if I did not get a chance to talk to you, or if you were not invited (space was limited).</p>

<p>We just got back from a short honeymoon on Canyon Lake. Thanks to Justin at the <a title="the lakehouse bed and breakfast on canyon lake" href="http://www.thelakehousebb.com" target="_blank">Lakehouse Bed and Breakfast</a> for a wonderful stay. I highly recommend this destination if you want to get away from it all without traveling for hours or breaking the bank.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re now trying to organize everything, merge old and new items, and establish some semblance of normalcy.</p>
