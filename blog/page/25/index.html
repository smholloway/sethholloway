      <h1 class="link"><a href="/learning-htmlcss/">Learning HTML/CSS?</a></h1>
      <p>Are you new to HTML/CSS? Knowing the basics of HTML/CSS is extremely useful. Below are a couple options to get started in learning HTML/CSS. There are great resources freely available at <a title="HTML Dog" href="http://htmldog.com/" target="_blank"><a href="http://htmldog.com/">http://htmldog.com/</a></a> and <a title="W3 Schools" href="http://www.w3schools.com/htmL/" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.w3schools.com/htmL/.">http://www.w3schools.com/htmL/.</a></a></p>

<p>So you understand there are tags opened and closed with angled brackets, &ldquo;&lt;&rdquo; and &ldquo;&gt;&rdquo;, now what? To create your site you have two main options:
1) SSH in and poke around. Edit files with your favorite editor (nano, pico, vi, etc.).</p>

<p>2) Modify files locally. This can be done easily two ways:</p>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;">2a) Download the Web Developer Toolbar addon for Firefox: <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/60" target="_blank">https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/60</a> then restart Firefox. Now you can use the toolbar to Edit CSS and Edit <span class="nfakPe">HTML</span> on any page you view. To edit CSS: right click a page-&gt;Web Developer-&gt;CSS-&gt;Edit CSS. To edit <span class="nfakPe">html</span>: right click a page-&gt;Web Developer-&gt;Miscellaneous-&gt;Edit <span class="nfakPe">HTML</span>. If you find a configuration you prefer, press the save button and keep a copy locally. When you&#8217;re satisfied, copy your copy to the server (scp, ftp, WinSSH, etc.).</div>


<div style="margin-left: 40px;">2b) Right click on the web page and choose &#8220;View Page Source&#8221; to get the <span class="nfakPe">html</span> page you&#8217;re currently viewing. For a pure <span class="nfakPe">html</span> page, this will give you everything you need to know. It does not work as well on pages generated by web programming languages (for example, viewing the source of a google page gives you near-nonsense because they&#8217;ve obfuscated the details with their Python generation). This method will work perfectly for the SSE page,  <a href="http://www.edge.utexas.edu/sse/SSE.css" target="_blank">http://www.edge.utexas.edu/sse/</a>. With the <span class="nfakPe">html</span> page in view, you should be able to find a style declaration. In the SSE index.<span class="nfakPe">html</span> you&#8217;ll see</div>


<blockquote>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"> <em>&lt;<span>style</span><span> media</span>=<span>&#8220;screen&#8221; </span><span>title</span>=<span>&#8220;currentStyle&#8221; </span><span>type</span>=<span>&#8220;text/css&#8221;</span>&gt;@import &#8220;SSE.css&#8221;;&lt;/<span>style</span>&gt;</em></span></div></blockquote>


<div style="margin-left: 40px;">So point your browser to the indicated style file; in this case <a href="http://www.edge.utexas.edu/sse/SSE.css" target="_blank">http://www.edge.utexas.edu/sse/SSE.css</a>. You&#8217;ll then have the style files.</div>


<p>Now you&rsquo;re on your way to figuring out the Internet! View and edit your favorite pages or create your own. If you see something you like, view the HTML/CSS and learn! It&rsquo;s quick, easy, and useful. Good luck!</p>

<p>Did I miss something? Was this useful? How did you learn HTML/CSS?</p>

<p>Update: Thanks for the help, Steve and <a title="Lane Holloway" href="http://www.laneholloway.com/" target="_blank">Lane</a>.</p>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/posting-drought/">Posting Drought</a></h1>
      <p>Some of you may have noticed that my post frequency has gone from one-a-day to about one-a-week. I reduced posting over the break as I had originally intended to be in Thailand. When that fell through I decided to try and take a vacation locally&ndash;that meant I quit my RSS habit and my blogging as well as school and work. In general, posts should decrease because I&rsquo;m sharing interesting articles over <a title="Seth Holloway's Google Reader" href="https://www.google.com/reader/shared/11451882993897049685" target="_blank">Google Reader</a> instead of my blog, so some of the shorter, link posts are out. I&rsquo;m still wickedly entertaining and full of great links, but less frequently on the blog.</p>

<p>Now that the semester has started back up, I&rsquo;m busy! I&rsquo;m working hard to get <a title="Sensor Enablement for the Average Programmer" href="http://mpc.ece.utexas.edu/SEAP/" target="_blank">SEAP</a> off the ground as my PhD topic. SEAP is an awesome idea that could change the world and bring aware homes to the masses&ndash;who doesn&rsquo;t like that? With a number of exciting directions, I&rsquo;m jazzed to research more!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m taking <a title="INF385 Course Website" href=" http://courses.ischool.utexas.edu/Bias_Randolph/2009/Spring/INF385P/" target="_blank">INF385, Introduction to Usability</a> in laymen&rsquo;s terms. It&rsquo;s an awesome class taught by <a title="Dr. Bias" href="http://www.ischool.utexas.edu/~rbias/web/index.shtml" target="_blank">Dr. Randolph Bias</a>; he has a great style, lots of cred, and teaches the closest thing to HCI that UT has. The class also ties in nicely to possible directions for SEAP. I&rsquo;m taking it in and enjoying every minute.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m also getting back into the swing of things with the <a title="Students in Software Engineering at UT" href="http://www.edge.utexas.edu/sse/" target="_blank">Students in Software Engineering</a>. This semester we&rsquo;re offering fewer meetings with an emphasis on creating community and providing useful knowledge. We&rsquo;re starting off right with a lecture by <a title="Herb Krasner" href="http://www.ece.utexas.edu/directory/faculty/48/" target="_blank">Herb Krasner</a> on <a title="Cost of Quality article" href="http://www.saspin.org/saspin_Sep99_krasner2.pdf" target="_blank">the cost of quality in software</a>. I&rsquo;m looking forward to it!</p>

<p>Also, while I&rsquo;m on campus I&rsquo;m working out again! I&rsquo;m going with my brother-in-law, Ryan, which gives us a good opportunity to get our beach bodies back while chatting about life. The exercise beyond biking is necessary&ndash;I can&rsquo;t let the Three Kings down.</p>

<p>Then there&rsquo;s <a title="Alliance IBM" href="http://allianceibm.org/" target="_blank">IBM. Unfortunately</a>, they&rsquo;ve been <a title="IBM lays off people quietly" href="http://kotaku.com/5140716/thousands-of-jobs-lost-very-quietly-at-ibm" target="_blank">laying people off</a> and I&rsquo;m left a little uncertain of my position. It&rsquo;s stressful, but I&rsquo;ll manage.</p>

<p>So that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s keeping me busy. What&rsquo;s up with you?</p>

      <p>We spend 1/3 of our lives sleeping, so why not enjoy that time? Beyond being a large part of our life, sleep is essential to proper brain function. Sleep affects memory, mood, and physical performance to name a few. Modern scientists recommend 7-8 hours of sleep per night, although before the advent of lights, humans slept 10-12 hours per night.</p>

<p>I was not a believer myself until last summer. I slept on a $400 mattress+box springs, and I planned to continue doing so until several years after the bed rotted into nothingness. However, that plan did not work for my wife. She encouraged me to go try new mattresses, so we did. The difference between the bed I had and the pricier ($800+) beds was remarkably apparent! It took me another couple days of thinking, but finally I decided to invest in restful sleep. (I got a <a title="Tempurpedic dot com" href="http://www.tempurpedic.com/" target="_blank">Tempurpedic</a> if you&rsquo;re wondering.) Since then I have slept much more soundly and been more comfortable.</p>

<p>Hopefully Ive convinced you, or you already know, that sleep is important. However, very few people invest in restful sleep. For instance, a nice bed. Beds are relatively cheap with expensive mattresses still coming in under $5,000. Compare that price to a car which can easily reach six figures&ndash;and you probably spend far less time in your car. I assure you the ROI of restful sleep is huge. A comfortable bed is worth every penny!</p>

<p>Do you believe? Have you upgraded your bed yet? When do you get the most restful sleep? Does the bed make a difference?</p>

      <p>I bought a PS3 as a media server: a central hub that would manage my entertainment. I struggled for days with <a title="WMP11 Official Site" href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/player/11/default.aspx" target="_blank">Windows Media Player 11</a>. <a title="Orb Official Site" href="http://www.orb.com/" target="_blank">Orb</a> solved my problems; however, I ran into issues with it. Broadly, Orb allows users to watch their media from anywhere. Orb is an amazing product! Just not what I needed.</p>

<p>The easiest method to setup the PS3 as a media server is <a title="TVersity Official Site" href="http://tversity.com/" target="_blank">TVersity</a>! You can find two good tutorials <a title="TVersity on PS3" href="http://www.ps3forums.com/showthread.php?t=75081" target="_blank">here</a> and <a title="TVersity on PS3 tutorial" href="http://weblog.bbzzdd.com/2007/08/04/optimizing-tversity-for-the-ps3-part-i/" target="_blank">here</a>. The most recent guide I&rsquo;ve followed, <a title="TVersity on PS3 with subtitles" href="http://davieslim.wordpress.com/2008/07/20/tversity-to-ps3/" target="_blank">here</a>, helps set up subtitles as well.</p>

<p>No matter what product you use, you&rsquo;ll likely have to adjust your OS firewall and your router&rsquo;s open ports. Luckily, the Google serves up the information quickly and easily. If you run into problems, let me know and I&rsquo;ll try to help. Good luck and enjoy!</p>

      <p>Over the holidays Wired published an article, <a title="Wired: Seven Best Capers of 2008" href="http://blog.wired.com/27bstroke6/2008/12/capers.html" target="_blank">the Seven Best Capers of 2008</a>, that ran down a list of crafty, entertaining schemes that ultimately resulted in the perpetrator getting caught. I encourage you to read the entire article; you&rsquo;ll find that every story involves a digital component. Here&rsquo;s the top rated heist:</p>

<blockquote><span class="capers_hed">The Snohomish Smokescreen</span>
<div class="desc">

In September, a robber disguised as a gardener pepper-sprayed an armored car driver using a pesticide sprayer and ran off with a bag stuffed with $400,000 in cash. When police arrived seconds later, they found the sidewalk crowded with dozens of men decked out in the same attire as the perp: blue shirt, Day-Glo vest, safety mask and glasses. While the cops hacked through a forest of suspects, the real perp fled to a nearby creek and escaped in a waiting inner tube.

Turns out the unwitting decoys had been lured to the crime scene by a Craigslist ad that promised construction work to those showing up in a &#8220;yellow vest, safety goggles, a respirator mask … and, if possible, a blue shirt.&#8221; A month later, following a lead from a homeless man who witnessed the preparation for the Brinks job, police arrested 28-year-old Anthony Curcio fresh from a Las Vegas vacation. Curcio is now charged with &#8220;Interference with commerce by threats or violence,&#8221; because &#8220;Pulling the most awesome robbery ever&#8221; isn&#8217;t listed in the U.S. code.</div></blockquote>


<p>Missing from the list are the scams by Wall Street, car companies, and any other bailout recipient as well as individuals like Bernie Madoff :)</p>

<p>While not as entertaining to watch as the daring <a title="IMDB: Ocean's 11" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0240772/" target="_blank">Ocean&rsquo;s 11</a>, the list helps to highlight how new media (using twitter to create flashmobs, for example) and cybercrime are the way of the future. A realistic movie about any one of these heists would involve a kid at a computer for days on end, slowly accumulating wealth.</p>

<p>Stealing physical items was much easier to catch and prosecute; with modern plots siphoning off fractions of a cent per transaction, we face a brave new world. America has to increase technological infrastructure, educate citizens about risks, and allow greater research into security.</p>

<p>What do you think? Have I misinterpreted? What&rsquo;s the future of crime and high-stake heists? How can we prevent it or at least mitigate the losses?</p>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/is-the-ivory-tower-crumbling/">Is the Ivory Tower crumbling?</a></h1>
      <p>An article, <a title="Rejecting the Academic Fast Track" href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2009/01/15/family" target="_blank">Rejecting the Academic Fast Track</a>, was posted January 15 on Inside Higher Ed. The article summarizes a study of over 8,300 graduate students in the University of California (UC) system; the study reveals that fewer graduate students are interested in pursuing tenure track positions at research universities. This is particularly interesting due to the large sample size and the strong academic performance of the UC schools (<a title="Wikipedia: UC" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California" target="_blank">two schools in the top 25 and 8 in the top 100</a>, Berkeley is <a title="UC-Berkeley 2 in CompEngr" href="http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/grad/eng/comp" target="_blank">top 5 in several</a> <a title="UC-Berkeley 2 in EE" href="http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/grad/eng/elec" target="_blank">engineering disciplines</a>, and <a title="Oldie but goodie" href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~landay/school-rankings94.txt" target="_blank">high rankings in law, medicine, and business</a>).</p>

<p>Study participants seem to echo Generation Y&rsquo;s desire to live a well-rounded life full of experiences and relationships (family) which academia does not foster. About 40% of the participants entered the PhD with academia in mind; after being part of the ivory tower the number had dropped ~10%. Roughly a quarter of the female PhDs said they would go into academia. With the number of female professors in the sciences and engineering already disproportionately low, this statistic should concern universities. The majority of those surveyed felt that teaching colleges were more in-line with their goals.</p>

<p>The study points out the issue and provides suggestions on how to alter future-professors&#8217; attitudes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Allow faculty members to shift to part-time status or temporarily elongate timelines over their academic lives without suffering career penalties.</li>
<li>Allow faculty members to take time out temporarily from their academic lives for care-giving and support their return.</li>
<li>Abandon the idea that academic stars are those who move through the ranks very quickly. and embrace the idea that the stars are those who produce the most important or relevant work  faster is not necessarily better.</li>
<li>Embrace the idea that it is fine to have children at any point in the career path because a full array of resources exists to support academic parents.</li>
<li>Challenge the stigma in which having children, particularly for women, is often equated with less seriousness and drive.</li>
</ul>


<p>The suggestions looks surprisingly similar to options in industry. It seems that the economy will change dramatically in the next decade: baby boomers will retire or expire leaving a hole in the workforce; 70% of young people want to work for themselves; the economy has taken a slant to services; Gen Y is collaborative, socially-minded, and entitled&ndash;ideas that go against the grain of current work culture.</p>
