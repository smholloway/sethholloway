      <p>Am I or will I ever be, one of those people who ever so nonchalantly mentions their extravagant travels and exotic friends? Sitting at a coffee shop one day I overheard a woman discussing all the wonderful things she had seen. Her audience, apparently an old friend, was less than impressed as the old hen prattled on with a constant stream of auto-laudations. I&rsquo;m fortunate: I&rsquo;ve led a very interesting life and experienced amazing things, but I do not want to bore my friends with inane details and persistent bragging. Travel is not a unique topic here&ndash;I&rsquo;ve heard people brag about experiences from guitar to shopping. I&rsquo;m left wondering how to talk about an exciting life without coming off like a braggart.</p>

<p>People should feel free to talk about subjects that interest them, but they should take note of social cues and change subjects more regularly. Beyond that, we should be confident but humble; approach conversation as two-way exchange of knowledge rather that a chance to tell every great story you have. My thoughts are still gestating, but I think this is a good starting point!</p>

      <p>April 17, 2008 is the day that the world will remember something great: Seth Holloway&rsquo;s first bike ride to campus. Despite living further from campus than ever before (and that&rsquo;s saying something since I&rsquo;ve been here for 7 years), I took the plunge and rode my bike today.</p>

<p>The five miles took thirty minutes in traffic. I arrived on campus fully awake and sweaty; a combination I had never experienced so early before. My only gripe was a Volvo-driving soccer mom who hugged the curb and kept me from riding up to the stoplight along the curb. All the other drivers were courteous and kind to this noob-biker.</p>

<p>As I get more fit, tune my bike better, and hit lights at the right time I think I could shave off five minutes pretty easily.  Here&rsquo;s to Austin weather staying pleasant enough for bike riding for weeks to come!</p>

<p>Thanks to Mike for excellent advice on the route and helping me to get comfortable riding my bike. Additional thanks to Tony and Dave for helping to acclimate me with the nuances of riding a bike to campus.</p>

      <p>Some people assert that cell phones are the rudest device ever unleashed on the world. While this may true, we cannot forget that all the people talking on cell phones are being more social while simultaneously being less social. Every sorority girl flapping her gums when she should have both hands on the wheel is communicating with another person. Every communication brings us closer to one another and closer to ourselves. In that regard, all these rude phone conversations that keep a person from interacting with the outside world are bringing the conversants closer to a select few. All in all I have felt the cold shoulder hefted upon me when someone chooses to speak on their cell phone instead of to me, but I have to think positively and credit them for interacting at all&ndash;unlike those iPod listeners&hellip;</p>

      <p>One of my goals in purchasing <a title="official site of seth holloway, duh" href="http://www.sethholloway.com">sethholloway.com</a> is to carve out my own niche on the Internet superhighway&ndash;the series of tubes invented by a politician from Tin-uh-see. However, as I google myself (which is even dirtier than it sounds) I can&rsquo;t help but feel that my job is not yet done. Many of my friends and peers have amazingly unique names, for example &ldquo;Jason&rdquo; or &ldquo;Steve,&rdquo; yet they are the top search results when you search for them!</p>

<p>All my life I thought I was unique. I recently discovered that everybody poops and more than two people per city are named Seth. Unfortunately for me, &ldquo;Seth Holloway&rdquo; is more popular statistically than &ldquo;Seth &lt;any other last name&gt;&rdquo; and as a result, there are a lot more Seth Holloways out there than I realized. But you know what? I&rsquo;m the only one with <a title="official site of seth holloway, duh" href="http://www.sethholloway.com">www.sethholloway.com</a>! :-p</p>

<p>If you, fair visitor, are another Seth Holloway please create <a title="official site of seth holloways, duh" href="http://sethholloways.com">sethholloways.com</a> so we can differentiate ourselves. If you are looking for another Seth Holloway, I wish you luck on your quest.</p>
