      <h1 class="link"><a href="/the-financial-crisis-pt-1/">The Financial Crisis Pt. 1</a></h1>
      <p>Different people have different takes on the financial crisis in America. Here&rsquo;s an <a title="Wall Street Quants Lied" href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/09/18/how-wall-streets-quants-lied-to-their-computers/" target="_blank">article that describes risk management</a>, which a federal requirement, and how analysts learned to manipulate the data to produce results they wanted&mdash;risky or not. The risk engines would have warned that the decisions being made were imprudent, and traders would have averted the crisis. I&rsquo;m not sure that bypassing risk predictions was the root cause, but I&rsquo;m sure it did not help our current situation.</p>

<p>So what do we do now? <a title="Comments" href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/09/18/how-wall-streets-quants-lied-to-their-computers/#comment-39729" target="_blank">Some readers</a> believe that the analysts should be supervised by ethics advisors or receive greater ethics training. The problem is not ethics. You cannot solve this by teaching ethics. The managers and traders knew what they were doing was worng and all the ethics in the world won&rsquo;t overwhelm greed. Ethics don&rsquo;t make money unless they&rsquo;re legislated, and the last thing we need is government intervention. Instead, we should be teaching finance students that the blind pursuit of gains led them to much larger losses. &ldquo;You gain more when you play it safer&rdquo; would appeal more to analysts than &ldquo;you gain more when you&rsquo;re ethical.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s another take on the <a title="NakedShorts" href="http://nakedshorts.typepad.com/nakedshorts/2008/09/a-nation-of-morons-led-by-idiots.html" target="_blank">financial crisis</a> that I find interesting. The author points out five problems and the nation&rsquo;s ridiculous solutions. The sarcasm ends with a plain, simple description of our problem:</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span style="text-align: justify; font-size: 14px; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS';">There is only one thing necessary to understanding what is happening and it is this: no one at US banks, no one at the Federal Reserve and no one in politics can accept the reality that real estate assets in this country remain oversupplied, overpriced and overleveraged.&rdquo;
</span></p>

<p>The description makes sense to me, at least at face value. A lot of people got rich off of real estate, but speculation and data manipulation lead to a skewed understanding of home values.Â  Let me explain with some numbers:</p>

<ul>
<li>In 2006 there were <a title="MarketWatch Home Numbers" href="http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/number-vacant-homes-sale-surges/story.aspx?guid={A09A933D-57BA-4583-BDF7-6E000DF9E74D}" target="_blank">126.7 million homes in America</a>.</li>
<li>About the same time the <a title="CIA World Factbook America" href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/print/us.html" target="_blank">estimated population was 301 million</a></li>
<li>Of those 301 million, approximately <a title="Gov Stats" href="http://www.census.gov/population/estimates/nation/intfile2-1.txt" target="_blank">200 million were over the age of 18</a>.</li>
<li>Of those ~200 million over 18, about <a title="Census data for college enrollment" href="http://www.census.gov/Press-Release/www/releases/archives/facts_for_features_special_editions/002263.html" target="_blank">16 million were in college</a></li>
</ul>


<p>If everyone over the age of 18 lived in a house, there would need to be 200 million homes. If everyone over the age of 18 was married, there would need to be 100 million homes. Realistically the number of people who <em>could</em> live in a home is somewhere in between&mdash;say 170 million. Now take out people in apartments, nursing homes, their parents&#8217; basement, etc and account for roommates. On the other end of the spectrum from cohabitating hippies, some people will own more than one house. For example, McCain has at least four houses, although he&rsquo;s <a title="McCain Not Sure How Many Houses He Owns" href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/laland/2008/08/mccain-not-sure.html" target="_blank">a little shaky on the exact number</a>. I&rsquo;m not convinced that enough people own multiple homes to make up for the glut of housing.</p>

<p>I found a blog that uses similar data and a little math to determine that <a title="Calculated Risk Blog" href="http://calculatedrisk.blogspot.com/2007/12/housing-inventory-and-rental-units.html" target="_blank">in 2006 there was an excess of 1.7 million homes</a>. Since then new home starts continued trotting along at a nice pace while the number of foreclosures skyrocketed, so the excess must be much larger now. It seems that, indeed, America has a serious glut of housing!</p>

      <p>The Russian stock market has <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/globalbiz/content/sep2008/gb20080917_169033.htm" target="_blank">lost over 64% since July</a>.

      <p><a title="Wired Meme Timeline Goes Viral" href="http://blog.wired.com/underwire/2008/09/track-the-life.html" target="_blank">Wired</a> said that the <a title="Internet Memes" href="http://www.dipity.com/user/tatercakes/timeline/Internet_Memes" target="_blank">Internet Meme timeline</a> is becoming a meme itself. I support the cause, so peruse the timeline and see how many memes you know!</p>

<p>For those of you who are wondering, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s a <a title="Wikipedia Meme" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme" target="_blank">meme</a>?&rdquo;:</p>

<ul>
<li>&ldquo;The term <strong>Internet meme</strong> is a <a title="Neologism" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neologism">neologism</a> used to describe a catchphrase or concept that spreads quickly from person to person via the <a title="Internet" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet">Internet</a>.&rdquo; &mdash; <a title="Wikipedia Internet Meme" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_meme" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a></li>
</ul>


<p>Confused? Think of any viral video, picture, or buzzword you&rsquo;ve ever been forwarded&mdash;it&rsquo;s probably a meme.</p>

<p>Still confused? Here&rsquo;s one of my favorite examples featuring a poorly dubbed Genesis game and some amazing Photoshop work:</p>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/the-future-of-mobile-devices/">The future of mobile devices</a></h1>
      <p>Google has a nice writeup on the <a title="Google Future of Mobile" href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2008/09/future-of-mobile.html" target="_blank">future of mobile devices</a> today. The article is aimed squarely at phones which may seem like an odd distinction. Despite the proliferation of mobile devices, phones are important because few handhelds can function as a phone. The Nintendo DS, for example, has WiFi capabilities, but no calling features. Also falling into this category are traditional PDAs, the iPod Touch, the Asus P735. Phones can add the ability to do many things (play games, stream media, chat, and cruise the web) easier than other devices can integrate calling.</p>

<p>Some futurists advocate specialized devices instead of the Swiss Army knife. The best example I&rsquo;ve heard is that a serious photographer will never use an integrated device like a camera phone. However, the average person doesn&rsquo;t seem to care&mdash;there are tons of camera phone pics being published online. Consumers generally decide by voting with their dollars and they&rsquo;re voting for all-in-one devices like the iPhone. The researchers may have a point, but there aren&rsquo;t many research articles that are as easy to read as the Google description :)</p>

<p>No matter where the market goes, I&rsquo;m happy to be part of such a promising field! Horray for mobile computing!</p>

<p>Oh, if you&rsquo;re wondering why Google would care, check out the <a title="Google Android" href="http://code.google.com/android/" target="_blank">Google-backed open handset initiative</a>, <a title="Wikipedia Android" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Android" target="_blank">Android</a>, which debuts this week.</p>

      <p>We saw Hamlet 2 last night. It was funnier than expected, and I am now a fan of Steve Coogan! I&rsquo;d give Hamlet 2 a 7/10. The rest of the world feels about the same:</p>

<ul>
<li><a title="IMDB Hamlet 2" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1104733/" target="_blank">IMDB</a> gave it a 6.4/10</li>
<li><a title="Rotten Tomatoes Hamlet 2" href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/hamlet_2/" target="_blank">Rotten Tomatoes</a> gave is a 63/100</li>
<li><a title="Metacritic Hamlet 2" href="http://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/hamlet2?q=hamlet%202" target="_blank">Metacritic</a> critics gave it a 5.4/10 while users gave is a 6.5/10</li>

      <p>I get a real kick out of <a title="Sneaky cat!" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLIPWjks_M " target="_blank">this simple video</a> (via <a title="Geekologie Ninja Cat..." href="http://www.geekologie.com/2008/09/ninja_cat_is_mad_stealthy_will.php" target="_blank">Geekologie</a>). It&rsquo;s a cat is stalking its owner, very sneakily. I have not seen moves like this since <a title="Wikipedia Red Light Green Light" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_light,_green_light" target="_blank">Red Light Green Light</a> in third grade!</p>

<object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="425" height="344" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/muLIPWjks_M&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="344" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/muLIPWjks_M&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object>


<p>My cat doesn&rsquo;t have to be as stealthy&mdash;he has enough mass and strength to overwhelm any phantom he encounters&mdash;but the video is still really cute.</p>

<p>On a somewhat related note, I&rsquo;m told that the kitty is actually an amazing hunter as recent animal psychology research says that prey animals scan for changes in the landscape. The cat&rsquo;s ability to maintain the same posture and be completely still make it an amazing predator. If you&rsquo;re interested in that idea, animals scanning their surroundings is discussed in depth in <a title="Amazon of Book" href="http://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Pictures-Other-Reports-Autism/dp/0679772898" target="_blank">Thinking in Pictures: and Other Reports from My Life with Autism</a>.</p>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/governess-palin-hacked/">Governess Palin hacked</a></h1>
      <p>Alaska Governess Palin had <a title="ZDNet coverage" href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/security/?p=1919" target="_blank">her Yahoo mail account hacked</a> recently. The hacker released a screenshot of one email:</p>

<p><a href="http://wikileaks.org/leak/sarah-palin-hack-2008/01.jpg"><img src="http://wikileaks.org/leak/sarah-palin-hack-2008/01.jpg" alt="Palin leaked email" /></a></p>

<p>It is out of context, but Palin seems loyal, friendly, and helpful. I&rsquo;m actually impressed.</p>

<p>I find the attack amusing, but I fear that going after high profile politicians is not the way to achieve anything. The hacker has likely hastened the end of net neutrality and Internet anonymity as politicians clamor for control. For hackers, of course, this is no worry because they&rsquo;re not going to be traced anyway, but it&rsquo;s bad for the rest of us.</p>

      <p>So the <a title="Interesting read on Lehman Bros" href="http://blogs.moneycentral.msn.com/topstocks/archive/2008/09/15/fed-to-wall-street-drop-dead.aspx" target="_blank">Feds let Lehman Bros fail</a>, but they&rsquo;re willing to <a title="Fed bails out AIG" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=a6QAz6YiyRAI&amp;refer=home" target="_blank">bail out AIG</a>? That must be frustrating for people at Lehman Bros! It is true that punishment was long overdo for Wall Street powermongerers, but we are all suffering for their sins.</p>

<p>This train of thought is new to me. Whenever the market started to go south (earlier this year), I was glad that the free market was punishing people who played fast and loose with other people&rsquo;s money. With house prices down and banks starting to falter, the dream of home ownership seemed within reach for me. The bad guys got hurt, and I could get onto the property ladder.</p>

<p>A sage accountant friend pointed out that we are all tied together, whether we like it or not. With the economy faltering everything is in flux; jobs are scarce, houses aren&rsquo;t worth what you paid for them months ago, and any money you have invested is hurting. My dream exists in a strong economy, not in a financial crisis. As with Enron, these criminals, who cost hard working people millions of dollars, will go (relatively) unpunished. They cannot repay the money because the money is gone; in the down economy they cannot make the money back either. We are defenseless against the devestation.</p>

<p>I am curious to see how the world can recover from such unexpected situations. For now, I withhold judgement and hope that the big brains in economics know what they&rsquo;re doing.</p>
