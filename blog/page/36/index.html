      <p><a title="Wired Meme Timeline Goes Viral" href="http://blog.wired.com/underwire/2008/09/track-the-life.html" target="_blank">Wired</a> said that the <a title="Internet Memes" href="http://www.dipity.com/user/tatercakes/timeline/Internet_Memes" target="_blank">Internet Meme timeline</a> is becoming a meme itself. I support the cause, so peruse the timeline and see how many memes you know!</p>

<p>For those of you who are wondering, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s a <a title="Wikipedia Meme" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme" target="_blank">meme</a>?&rdquo;:</p>

<ul>
<li>&ldquo;The term <strong>Internet meme</strong> is a <a title="Neologism" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neologism">neologism</a> used to describe a catchphrase or concept that spreads quickly from person to person via the <a title="Internet" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet">Internet</a>.&rdquo; &mdash; <a title="Wikipedia Internet Meme" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_meme" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a></li>
</ul>


<p>Confused? Think of any viral video, picture, or buzzword you&rsquo;ve ever been forwarded&mdash;it&rsquo;s probably a meme.</p>

<p>Still confused? Here&rsquo;s one of my favorite examples featuring a poorly dubbed Genesis game and some amazing Photoshop work:</p>

      <p>Google has a nice writeup on the <a title="Google Future of Mobile" href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2008/09/future-of-mobile.html" target="_blank">future of mobile devices</a> today. The article is aimed squarely at phones which may seem like an odd distinction. Despite the proliferation of mobile devices, phones are important because few handhelds can function as a phone. The Nintendo DS, for example, has WiFi capabilities, but no calling features. Also falling into this category are traditional PDAs, the iPod Touch, the Asus P735. Phones can add the ability to do many things (play games, stream media, chat, and cruise the web) easier than other devices can integrate calling.</p>

<p>Some futurists advocate specialized devices instead of the Swiss Army knife. The best example I&rsquo;ve heard is that a serious photographer will never use an integrated device like a camera phone. However, the average person doesn&rsquo;t seem to care&mdash;there are tons of camera phone pics being published online. Consumers generally decide by voting with their dollars and they&rsquo;re voting for all-in-one devices like the iPhone. The researchers may have a point, but there aren&rsquo;t many research articles that are as easy to read as the Google description :)</p>

<p>No matter where the market goes, I&rsquo;m happy to be part of such a promising field! Horray for mobile computing!</p>

<p>Oh, if you&rsquo;re wondering why Google would care, check out the <a title="Google Android" href="http://code.google.com/android/" target="_blank">Google-backed open handset initiative</a>, <a title="Wikipedia Android" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Android" target="_blank">Android</a>, which debuts this week.</p>

      <p>We saw Hamlet 2 last night. It was funnier than expected, and I am now a fan of Steve Coogan! I&rsquo;d give Hamlet 2 a 7/10. The rest of the world feels about the same:</p>

<ul>
<li><a title="IMDB Hamlet 2" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1104733/" target="_blank">IMDB</a> gave it a 6.4/10</li>
<li><a title="Rotten Tomatoes Hamlet 2" href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/hamlet_2/" target="_blank">Rotten Tomatoes</a> gave is a 63/100</li>
<li><a title="Metacritic Hamlet 2" href="http://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/hamlet2?q=hamlet%202" target="_blank">Metacritic</a> critics gave it a 5.4/10 while users gave is a 6.5/10</li>

      <p>I get a real kick out of <a title="Sneaky cat!" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLIPWjks_M " target="_blank">this simple video</a> (via <a title="Geekologie Ninja Cat..." href="http://www.geekologie.com/2008/09/ninja_cat_is_mad_stealthy_will.php" target="_blank">Geekologie</a>). It&rsquo;s a cat is stalking its owner, very sneakily. I have not seen moves like this since <a title="Wikipedia Red Light Green Light" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_light,_green_light" target="_blank">Red Light Green Light</a> in third grade!</p>

<object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="425" height="344" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/muLIPWjks_M&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="344" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/muLIPWjks_M&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object>


<p>My cat doesn&rsquo;t have to be as stealthy&mdash;he has enough mass and strength to overwhelm any phantom he encounters&mdash;but the video is still really cute.</p>

<p>On a somewhat related note, I&rsquo;m told that the kitty is actually an amazing hunter as recent animal psychology research says that prey animals scan for changes in the landscape. The cat&rsquo;s ability to maintain the same posture and be completely still make it an amazing predator. If you&rsquo;re interested in that idea, animals scanning their surroundings is discussed in depth in <a title="Amazon of Book" href="http://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Pictures-Other-Reports-Autism/dp/0679772898" target="_blank">Thinking in Pictures: and Other Reports from My Life with Autism</a>.</p>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/governess-palin-hacked/">Governess Palin hacked</a></h1>
      <p>Alaska Governess Palin had <a title="ZDNet coverage" href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/security/?p=1919" target="_blank">her Yahoo mail account hacked</a> recently. The hacker released a screenshot of one email:</p>

<p><a href="http://wikileaks.org/leak/sarah-palin-hack-2008/01.jpg"><img src="http://wikileaks.org/leak/sarah-palin-hack-2008/01.jpg" alt="Palin leaked email" /></a></p>

<p>It is out of context, but Palin seems loyal, friendly, and helpful. I&rsquo;m actually impressed.</p>

<p>I find the attack amusing, but I fear that going after high profile politicians is not the way to achieve anything. The hacker has likely hastened the end of net neutrality and Internet anonymity as politicians clamor for control. For hackers, of course, this is no worry because they&rsquo;re not going to be traced anyway, but it&rsquo;s bad for the rest of us.</p>

      <p>So the <a title="Interesting read on Lehman Bros" href="http://blogs.moneycentral.msn.com/topstocks/archive/2008/09/15/fed-to-wall-street-drop-dead.aspx" target="_blank">Feds let Lehman Bros fail</a>, but they&rsquo;re willing to <a title="Fed bails out AIG" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=a6QAz6YiyRAI&amp;refer=home" target="_blank">bail out AIG</a>? That must be frustrating for people at Lehman Bros! It is true that punishment was long overdo for Wall Street powermongerers, but we are all suffering for their sins.</p>

<p>This train of thought is new to me. Whenever the market started to go south (earlier this year), I was glad that the free market was punishing people who played fast and loose with other people&rsquo;s money. With house prices down and banks starting to falter, the dream of home ownership seemed within reach for me. The bad guys got hurt, and I could get onto the property ladder.</p>

<p>A sage accountant friend pointed out that we are all tied together, whether we like it or not. With the economy faltering everything is in flux; jobs are scarce, houses aren&rsquo;t worth what you paid for them months ago, and any money you have invested is hurting. My dream exists in a strong economy, not in a financial crisis. As with Enron, these criminals, who cost hard working people millions of dollars, will go (relatively) unpunished. They cannot repay the money because the money is gone; in the down economy they cannot make the money back either. We are defenseless against the devestation.</p>

<p>I am curious to see how the world can recover from such unexpected situations. For now, I withhold judgement and hope that the big brains in economics know what they&rsquo;re doing.</p>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/more-about-bar-stool-economics/">More about Bar Stool Economics</a></h1>
      <p>After <a title="update on bar stool eco" href="http://sethholloway.com/blog/?p=117" target="_blank">misunderstanding</a> the <a title="bar stool economics" href="http://sethholloway.com/blog/?p=115" target="_blank">Bar Stool Economics</a> story, I&rsquo;ve thought about the issue some more.</p>

<p>At first blush, the story is astounding. One group pays 59% while five other groups only have to kick in 1%! To gain a better understanding I <a title="Google Spreadsheet" href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=pICAKzgZ-9PDupCqMjtLQdQ" target="_blank">played with the numbers</a> and got some basic results. Using a flat tax I generated generic income data for 10 aggregate groups as in the Bar Stool &ldquo;lesson.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With a linear distribution of wealth, the top group (10) made 10 times as much as the lowest earning group (1). In this case, the highest earners made 18.18% of all the money and paid 18.18% of all taxes (using the flat tax to simplify the calculations) while the poorest group paid only 1.82% of all taxes.</p>

<p>Whenever we use an exponential distribution of wealth using a growth factor of 2, we get results that are very similar to the Bar Stool&rsquo;s numbers. Whenever the top grossing group outpaces the poorest group by a factor of 512 (2<sup>9</sup>), the highest earners receive a shade over 50% of all income. In this case the lowest five groups make roughly 2% of all the income. Rounding to the nearest dollar, we see that the lowest four groups would basically drink for free.</p>

<p>The Bar Stool Economics story confused me. Now I understand that it is actually a profound musing on the distribution of wealth in America. Simply reduce the gap between rich and poor and no one will have to pay too much ;&ndash;)</p>

<p>Just kidding. Clearly, the disparity between the rich and poor is enormous. For example, CEO of Exxon, Rex, makes <a title="Reuters public data about compensation" href="http://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/companyOfficers?symbol=XOM.N&amp;viewId=comp" target="_blank">16M a year from the company</a>; the guy at Burger King will <a title="Govt stats on minimum wage" href="http://www.dol.gov/esa/whd/flsa/" target="_blank">make about $13K a year</a>. That&rsquo;s a difference of 123077%. That&rsquo;s not unfair; I want in on that gravy train too! But it makes sense that the highest earners will pay the largest percentage of taxes because they make the largest percentage of wealth.</p>

<p>The problem exposed by the Bar Stool Economics story is the progressive nature of the American tax system is unfair. <em>The highest earners are paying a huge percentage of the taxes; a</em>s the <a title="Wikipedia Taxation in the US" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxation_in_the_United_States" target="_blank">Hive Mind</a> tells us &ldquo;<em>&hellip;the top 1% with gross income of $328,049 or more pay 36.9% (earning 19%)&hellip;&rdquo;</em> A flat tax would be a much better system.</p>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/update-bar-stool-economics/">Update: Bar Stool Economics</a></h1>
      <p>So I just received an explanation sans metaphor regarding the <a title="Seth Holloway Bar Stool Economics" href="http://sethholloway.com/blog/?p=115" target="_blank">Bar Stool Economics</a>; my analysis was off. The 10 people represent the US taxpayers broken into buckets by earnings. The top earning 10% (the tenth drinker) pay roughly 70% of the total tax dollars. Whenever the &ldquo;lesson&rdquo; was written, 59% was probably accurate&mdash;we are now more progressive. The bottom 50% of earners are not contributing much to the total pool (3.3% of the total dollars spent), so the bottom 5 drinkers would pay about $4 of the $100 tab in the analogy. The story makes sense; my bad.</p>

<p>Oh, and I didn&rsquo;t mention it specifically but the estate tax sucks.</p>

<p>Also, from my purview, the government will never repeal taxes so taxes will always rise. As such, we should resist any new taxes.</p>
