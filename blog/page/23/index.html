      <p>Better late than never, right?</p>

<p>Last Sunday I returned from Vancouver where I was attending the International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE). I met a lot of great and interesting people. A few that stand out are</p>

<ul>
<li>Sherlock Licorish &ndash; the soft-spoken researcher from Guyana who told me I was an academic</li>
<li><a title="Justin Erenkrantz -- UCI student and ASF pres" href="http://www.erenkrantz.com/" target="_blank">Justin Erenkrantz</a> &ndash; the President of the Apache Software Foundation who was really down to Earth and cool</li>
<li><a title="Andy Ko -- CMU student to UW prof" href="http://faculty.washington.edu/ajko/" target="_blank">Andy Ko</a> &ndash; a professor finishing up his first year at University of Washington. Andy was an all-around great person: articulate, helpful, funny</li>
</ul>


<p>I also had the honor of hanging out with a couple esteemed colleagues, <a title="Drew Stovall" href="http://www.dstovall.com" target="_blank">Drew Stovall</a> and <a title="Hyrum Wright" href="http://www.hyrumwright.org" target="_blank">Hyrum Wright</a>, and my wonderful wife.</p>

<p>And a big thanks to the person that made this all possible, <a title="Christine's awesomely outdated page :)" href="http://users.ece.utexas.edu/~julien/" target="_blank">Dr. Christine Julien</a>.</p>

<p>Vancouver was an amazing city! I feel extremely glad to be able to see the Pacific Northwest in the late Spring/early Summer. We experienced temperaturesÂ  in the 40s to 70 with ample sunshine and a light breeze. By most definitions, near perfect weather. In the eight days we were there it only rained once! Of course, that was the day we were on an open-top zodiac chasing whales, but the experience was too cool to let a little rain get in the way (my retrospective opinion, not the opinion I held while freezing on the chilly waters of the Pacific Ocean). We had awesome Japanese food, terrific Chinese food, a tasty bubble tea, and other ethnic fare that was totally worthwhile.</p>

<p>Before ICSE, we were in Madison, WI to see my sister graduate with her PhD. Her research was about DBMSs on flash disks. Congratulations to her on this momentous ocassion. We&rsquo;re all very proud!</p>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/designing-based-on-data/">Designing Based on Data</a></h1>
      <p>After my last Usability course this semester a designer/peer, <a title="Andrea Richeson" href="http://andrearicheson.org/wordpress/" target="_blank">Andrea Richeson</a>, were chatting. She asked me if the course had changed the way I think about designers. I did not have a good answer at the time because I fancy myself a bit of a designer: I&rsquo;ve created several websites (<a title="Mobile and Pervasive Computing @ UT" href="http://mpc.ece.utexas.edu/" target="_blank">MPC</a>, <a title="Software Engineering @ UT" href="http://www.edge.utexas.edu/se/" target="_blank">SE</a>, <a title="Students in Software Engineering @ UT" href="http://www.edge.utexas.edu/se/" target="_blank">SSE</a>, <a title="Seth Holloway Dot Com" href="http://www.sethholloway.com/" target="_blank">SethHolloway.com</a>) and I constantly build/tinker in both virtual and physical spaces. Beyond considering myself a programmer and designer, I found usability testing to be an amazingly practical part of creating something for people. The methods are similar to my favorite software development methodology: agile development&mdash;get the requirements, do a small piece, fix what is broken and ensure people like the effort so far, repeat. After some reflection I can say the course did not really change my view on design, it gave me a framework for evaluating and altering design based on user data.</p>

<p>Fresh out of the class with a solid understanding of the art of usability testing, I was taken aback while reading a New York Times <a title="Ping - Design Based on Data" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/10/business/10ping.html" target="_blank">article about a designer who left Google and went to Twitter</a>. He left Google because of their rigid adherence to trusting data. I am confused how a designer could disagree with trusting data. If you do not like this approach, you don&rsquo;t believe in (1) the way they collect data or (2) trusting the users. The article does not explain how Google collects their data nor does it explain the designer&rsquo;s disdain, but from what I read I think Google&rsquo;s approach is perfect.</p>

<p>Google receives millions of unique visitors per day and they are known for changing elements on the page (think of the whimsical, dynamic elements like logo changes and the &ldquo;Feeling Lucky&rdquo; button), so it is not hard to believe that Google would put up different designs of the same page. Now, a fraction of the millions of users sees one design and another fraction sees the other design. From the web server&rsquo;s standpoint, data collection is fairly easy&mdash;especially with AJAX-enabled dynamic pages: just stream events to the server for logging. Later, a human can analyze the data and make decisions. With sample sizes in the thousands, statistical validity is almost guaranteed!</p>

<p>The approach is wonderful: people&rsquo;s behavior determines the best design for the job and the data is collected without the user&rsquo;s knowledge. What&rsquo;s better than getting people&rsquo;s feedback without their knowledge? Hidden camera shows have always exposed wonderful insights, but we can only get at the truth when people let their guard down.</p>

<p>That is how I imagine the data is collected and the approach seems infalible, thus I must conclude that the designer does not believe in trusting users despite the flawless data collection methods. Even outlandish designs can yield positive results. I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;m missing nuances, but I side with Google. I believe in designing based on data because it keeps us moving towards usable, pleasing designs.</p>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/richard-stallmans-mistaken-thinking-on-copyright/">Richard Stallman&#8217;s Mistaken Thinking on Copyright</a></h1>
      <p>Last Friday I had the honor of seeing <a title="Richard Stallman's Home Page" href="http://www.stallman.org/" target="_blank">Richard Stallman</a>, or <a title="Wikipedia: Richard Stallman" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman" target="_blank">rms</a> as he&rsquo;s known in the computer underground, delivering a lecture about copyright in the digital age at UT.</p>

<p>First, a note on his appearance: I was near the back of a 300-person auditorium, but he looked fairly presentable. He has long hair and a ratty beard, but he was dressed in a clean, bright red shirt and slacks. He wore black Velcro shoes which he quickly slid out of. Another interesting visual was his perfectly spherical basketball-sized belly that stretched his shirt tight against his torso. It was truly amazing given his thin arms and legs!</p>

<p>And now onto the intellectual bits&hellip;</p>

<p>Stallman is a big believer in freedom, and he believes that software should be free (as in speech, not as in beer). Rather than referring to price, free software means the user is free to do what they please, namely <a title="Free Software Foundation Definition" href="http://www.fsf.org/about/what-is-free-software" target="_blank">modify and share</a>. Here&rsquo;s the <a title="Free Software" href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html" target="_blank">definition from the horse&rsquo;s mouth</a>:</p>

<blockquote><em>Free software is a matter of the users&#8217; freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software.  More precisely, it refers to four kinds of freedom, for the users of the software: </em>

 * <em>The freedom to run the program, for any purpose (freedom 0).</em>
 * <em>The freedom to study how the program works, and adapt it to your needs (freedom 1). Access to the source code is a precondition       for this. </em>
 * <em>The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor (freedom 2). </em>
 * <em>The freedom to improve the program, and release your improvements (and modified versions in general) to the public, so that the whole community benefits (freedom 3). Access to the source code is a precondition for this.</em>

</blockquote>


<p>His ideas are very extreme&mdash;likely galvanized by having to defend his position for 20+ years. I did not appreciate his call to &ldquo;argue the moral high ground&rdquo; which generally means &ldquo;use emotion instead of logic.&rdquo; To be sure, people make decisions based on emotion rather than logic, but his call-to-arms felt flimsy without proper reasoning to back the argument.</p>

<p>Along the emotional lines, he lividly proclaimed that &lsquo;people who attack sharing are attacking society because sharing forms the bonds of society!&rsquo; &ldquo;Sharing is good&rdquo; he said in a moment that made me conjure kindergarten memories. He also evokes the positive nostalgia of browsing your friend&rsquo;s library and borrowing a book. He mocked the idea of borrowing an e-book and, with the e-book, the entire e-reader that it is bound to. These ideas form the basis of his argument that sharing should continue with digital works.</p>

<p>After ruminating on the subject and discussing it with a few peers, I believe that Stallman had the right information but came to the wrong conclusion. The fundamental issue is sharing. Traditionally, sharing involves physical objects that cannot conform to his four freedoms; with physical objects there is only one copy of an item that cannot be easily replicated. He claims that a physical object is its own source code and the user is free to alter it and share the object. This is the first mistake: digital objects have recipes, blueprints, and materials that are the source code. Software today is a standalone product that you pay for&mdash;as with physical objects, the source will cost you.</p>

<p>Stallman&rsquo;s second mistake comes when he equates the digital analog of sharing physical objects into modifying and distributing new copies. Physical objects can be modified and distributed, but the owner gives up the object (for some period of time) whenever they share. As time passes the item changes hands and wears (nicks, folds, scratches, pen marks, etc). If a user wants access to the physical object again, they have to get it back from the borrower or buy a new version. Stallman is not the only person to make this mistake. Currently, there are only two possibilities with digital work:</p>

<ul>
<li>DRM style: one user per purchase &mdash; no possibility of sharing</li>
<li>Napster style: many users per purchase &mdash; sharing is common</li>
</ul>


<p>We need a third method that truly mirrors traditional sharing. This digital system would allow you to share with your friends without retaining a copy for yourself.</p>

<p>Years ago, the music and motion pictures industries (digital media publishers) that are &ldquo;losing sales&rdquo; to piracy should have created a system that allows users to purchase one copy to do with as they please. A simple solution is to create a central web server that contains all available material. Access is then controlled based on holding the license to the material. If a person wants to share or sell media, the user should give up their license and pass it on. We could make the access control very user-friendly, virtually transparent, while providing ubiquitous access and promoting sales.</p>

<p>Sharing is good. We should foster the bonds of sharing. We should not proliferate copying.</p>

      <p>I&rsquo;m not a fan of the patent system&mdash;it&rsquo;s broken at best&mdash;so I always enjoy seeing the ridiculous things that companies patent! American companies are seeking bailout money while laying off US workers. In this tough economic time, perhaps companies should forego filing a <a title="IBM terminates US employees and patents it" href="http://www.informationweek.com/news/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=216402013" target="_blank">patent on how to outsource</a>.</p>

<p>We are in for a radical shift in the way people buy cars, and the existing excess supply will be worthless. Car companies should drop the unions, sell the backlog off at any price, and embrace the future.</p>

<p>There are a couple great TED talks on the subject:</p>

      <p>This week I attended the <a title="PerCom Official Site" href="http://www.percom.org/" target="_blank">IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications</a> in Galveston, TX. I was there to present my paper <a title="Opening Pervasive Computing to the Masses Using SEAP" href="http://mpc.ece.utexas.edu/Papers/TR-UTEDGE-2008-015.pdf" target="_blank">Opening Pervasive Computing to the Masses Using the SEAP Middleware</a>. If you&rsquo;re interested, here are the slides I presented at the <a title="PerWare 2009" href="http://perware.cs.uiuc.edu/" target="_blank">PerWare workshop</a> Monday morning: seap-sethholloway-perware2009.</p>

<p>The conference itself was a good experience: I received a lot of interesting questions and good feedback. The feedback focuses my future work and will help me become a better presenter. <a title="Hubert Needs a Website" href="http://www.csail.mit.edu/people/768" target="_blank">Hubert Pham</a>, a student under Steve Ward at CSAIL, gave a stellar presentation on goal oriented programming. I also met one of Hubert&rsquo;s co-authors, <a title="Justin Mazzola Paluska from CSAIL @ MIT" href="http://www.mit.edu/~jmp/" target="_blank">Justin Mazzola Paluska</a>. Not only are they great researchers, they&rsquo;re cool guys.</p>

<p>Beyond meeting a couple promising peers, I got to meet <a title="Dr. Gregory Abowd of Georgia Tech" href="http://www.gregoryabowd.com/" target="_blank">Dr. Gregory Abowd</a>&mdash;the highlight of the trip. Dr. Abowd is one of my favorite researchers. He gave a very inspirational keynote to open the conference. He is a prince of a man, and I hope to interact with him more in the future.</p>

<p>I was also glad to see Galveston in fair shape. After Hurricane Ike the island was in very bad shape. Although the bulk of the beach is yet to be repaired this spring break the island can host a fair number of tourists. Luckily, there were signs of life outside the plethora of PerCommers.</p>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/the-top-100-modern-books/">The Top 100 (Modern) Books</a></h1>
      <p>The BBC compiled a <a title="BBC Big Read" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/arts/bigread/top100.shtml" target="_blank">list of the 100 most loved books</a>, as voted by Brits. There is a definite slant to modern books; more precisely, books that have been turned into movies. I also found it interested that England&rsquo;s richest female, JK Rowling, is disproportionately listed (four of the seven Harry Potter series in the top 25). Notably absent from the list is iconic libertarian author Ayn Rand whose book, <a title="Ayn Rand Institude: Atlas Shrugged Sales Up" href="http://www.aynrand.org/site/News2?page=NewsArticle&amp;id=22647" target="_blank">Atlas Shrugged, is seeing increased sales recently</a>. Rand fled communist Russia and developed a philosophy that almost perfectly counters the opinions on those she feared; Karl Marx wrote plenty that opposes Rand. Marx and Rand are arguably two of the most influential philosophers of the 20th century (not that the 20th century will be known for philosophy), yet neither is represented.</p>

<p>The <a title="Time: Top 100 Books" href="http://www.time.com/time/2005/100books/the_complete_list.html" target="_blank">Time list</a> (compiled by critics) also ignores Rand. The <a title="Random House's Top 100" href="http://www.randomhouse.com/modernlibrary/100bestnovels.html" target="_blank">Modern Library has two lists</a>, one from critics and one from users. Their critic list does not have Rand, yet their user list contains four Rand books in the top 10! Continuing to look I found that (perhaps) objectivism is more popular amongst men as Rand appears on the <a title="The Art of Manliness: 100 Must-Read Books" href="http://artofmanliness.com/2008/05/14/100-must-read-books-the-essential-mans-library/" target="_blank">100 Must-Read Books in the Essential Man&rsquo;s Library</a>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m really shocked because the dreaded classics appear all over the lists! In several discussions of literature I&rsquo;ve only met one person who enjoyed the classics; my peers all hated the books we slogged through in high school. That&rsquo;s not to say the classics are not important, but I do not relate with the baroque period like I do modern times. My favorite writer, Neal Stephenson, does not appear on these lists, although Snow Crash has topped <a title="Time: Snow Crash as rated by readers" href="http://www.time.com/time/2005/100books/0,24459,snow_crash,00.html" target="_blank">lists of readers&#8217; choice</a>. What&rsquo;s wrong with these lists? Put on your tin foil hats because I think there&rsquo;s a conspiracy!</p>

<p>Each list highlights the problems of sampling human subjects, for example: selection bias, poor controls, and privacy concerns among others. In the end, books are entertainment and entertainment is completely subjective. Do what you like and let me do the same.</p>

<p>What do you think of the lists? Is there one that aligns with your tastes? Do you like the classics? What authors or books are missing?</p>

      <p><a title="Lane Holloway" href="http://www.laneholloway.com/" target="_blank">Lane</a> isn&rsquo;t the only one changing his theme! After upgrading to the impressive new Wordpress 2.7 I found the beautiful <a title="Wordpress Theme: Gears" href="http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/gear" target="_blank">Gears theme</a> and edited it to fit my tastes. I hope you enjoy the updated look. Integrating <a title="Google Analytics" href="http://www.google.com/analytics/" target="_blank">Google Analytics</a> into the new theme took a couple tweaks, similar to <a title="Seth Holloway: Let Google do the Heavy Lifting" href="http://sethholloway.com/blog/2009/02/19/let-google-do-the-heavy-lifting/" target="_blank">putting Analytics into the default theme</a>. If you need help adding Analytics to Gears, send me a message and I&rsquo;ll try to help.</p>

<p>So, what do you think? Is Gears, as customized by yours truly, not wicked awesome?</p>
