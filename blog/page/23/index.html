      <p>Friday (September 5) marked the kickoff of the Students in Software Engineering (SSE), an organization that I started with my labmate and friend, Justin Enderle. The idea for the organization started in spring 2008 during Software Engineering faculty candidate interviews. As a newer student Justin did not know his peers sitting around the table. In a relatively small department like Software Engineering, the students should know one another.</p>

<p>We started sowing the seeds this summer. Our goal was simple: unite the students in Software Engineering. However, formalizing that goal and deciding how to proceed has involved a great deal of work. We had numerous meetings with EDGE assistant director, Rick Scott, as well as our adviser, Dr. Christine Julien, as we hammered out the kinks. I&rsquo;m extremely proud of our progress!</p>

<p>After a great deal of effort and a lot of lessons learned, we were able to launch successfully! Our first meeting featured a mix of sodas and water, lots of Domino&rsquo;s pizza, and a talk by the always awesome Dr. Christine Julien. We had 31 students and 3 faculty from the Software Engineering track in attendance. Our favorite oracle, Rick Scott, also showed up&ndash;woot!</p>

<p>In addition to a strong turnout and positive feedback, the organization gained two excellent new officers: Dave DeAngelis and Robert Grant. With the extra help the organization is stronger than ever, and Justin and I should be able to continue doing our jobs&ndash;researching :)</p>

<p>Overall, I am very pleased with our first meeting and our general progress. I&rsquo;ve learned a lot about starting an organization, marketing your brand, managing people, and being a constructive, productive audience member. I look forward to future lessons-learned and organizational successes!</p>

      <p>It&rsquo;s no doubt that I love <a title="official website" href="http://www.halfpricebooks.com/" target="_blank">Half Price Books</a> as much as the next guy: they have a great selection, (relatively) clean store, friendly employees, and convenient locations. However, this wonderful store does not have an inventory system. When you ask the friendly employee in the clean, convenient location if they have the new <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Dora the Explorer</span> <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Harry Potter</span> Arnold <span>Schwarzenegger</span> book, they can only tell you where they think it would be located. There&rsquo;s no definitive, &ldquo;Oh, yes! We have that!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The whole situation is odd since books are easier to track than many other physical goods&ndash;they have barcodes and unique identification numbers. As I understand it, all businesses have to take physical inventory periodically. If anyone in the Half Price Books organization knows what they have on hand, why not open the database for use? My guess is that they probably capture a lot of business from people browsing. A couple weeks ago we went in to get one specific book and walked out with five others that we found along the way. It&rsquo;s unclear whether or not we would have bought the other books without the necessary browsing.</p>

<p>Integrating a search feature into the website would also be handy. I understand that companies should stick to what they&rsquo;re good at, and Half Price Books has done well so far; however, opening the inventory system to search would be a straightforward task that would easily put Half Price Books ahead the elite booksellers.</p>

      <p>I&rsquo;m a big fan of the Google suite of products. I&rsquo;ve been connecting via <a title="https on wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Https" target="_blank">https</a> for a while now, but Google has now made it easier. There&rsquo;s a <a title="Encrypt your Gmail!" href="http://www.webmonkey.com/blog/Why_You_Should_Turn_Gmail_s_SSL_Feature_On_Now" target="_blank">great article on Wired</a> about encrypting your Gmail. Anyone using the Google services should do this immediately. Here&rsquo;s a quick how-to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Log in to Gmail (<a title="GMAIL!" href="https://mail.google.com/mail/" target="_blank"><a href="https://mail.google.com/mail/">https://mail.google.com/mail/</a></a>)</li>
<li>In Gmail, click on &ldquo;Settings&rdquo; in the top right corner (beside your username).</li>
<li>Scroll to the &ldquo;Browser connection&rdquo; section at the bottom of the page</li>
<li>Click the radio button for &ldquo;Always use https&rdquo;</li>
<li>Click the &ldquo;Save changes: button at the bottom of the page</li>
<li>Profit</li>

      <p>Over the past six months I have been getting roughly one call per day from random 800 numbers from all over the country. The voice changes, but the message is always the same: &lsquo;This is the second notice that your car warranty is about to expire.&rsquo;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve spoken to other people who are also getting the calls. A friend of mine just bought a car and is receiving these ominous messages which cannot be true.</p>

<p>The worst part is that I&rsquo;m on the <a title="block phone spam" href="https://www.donotcall.gov/" target="_blank">National Do Not Call Registry</a> which should protect me from these unwanted phone calls. Does anyone know of a class action lawsuit against the filth behind these calls? Does anyone know how to file a class action lawsuit&hellip;</p>

<p>Edit: Thanks for pointing out the typo Jason :)</p>

      <p>After watching Sicko I have been more interested in the American health care situation. I don&rsquo;t trust the government to provide high-quality health care coverage. Moore speaks highly of the English system, but a common perk for jobs in the UK (<a title="effects on Brits who choose private health care" href="http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/tax-advice/income-tax/article.html?in_article_id=408244&amp;in_page_id=77" target="_blank">private health care coverage</a>) suggests that the system is less than perfect. Benefits of America&rsquo;s quasi-privatized system are a wash: a person can receive care, but insurance rarely covers the entire cost of operations and medicine. There are a number of other issues at work (governmental regulations, the patent system, market competition, a lack of care for mentally-ill, &hellip;); however, my intent for this post is not to cover any of these complex issues, nor is it to enrage people or debate over the advantages and disadvantages of private health care. Instead, I simply want to share a solution that I find very clever and achievable: <a title="LetWalMartFixUSHealthCare" href="http://articles.moneycentral.msn.com/Investing/JubaksJournal/LetWalMartFixUSHealthCare.aspx" target="_blank">Let Wal-Mart Fix American Health Care</a>.</p>

<p>If they can roll back prices on so many everyday products, they should be able to hardball health care providers and pass the savings on to the consumers. I&rsquo;ll worship the Church of Wal-Mart if it saves me any of the $3,600 a year I pay for health care for my family.</p>

      <p>What is the resolution of unaltered human sight? Computers are slowly pushing their capability higher: from 800x600 to 1920x1200 and beyond. I&rsquo;m left wondering &ldquo;When will the screen resolution catch our innate capabilities?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The answer is not simple and estimates differ on the resolution (<a title="acuity, resolution, ...what now?" href="http://www.clarkvision.com/imagedetail/eye-resolution.html" target="_blank">324 megapixel</a>, <a title="deviantart estimate of human resolution" href="http://news.deviantart.com/article/27174/" target="_blank">576 megapixels</a> to <a title="vision" href="http://www.swift.ac.uk/vision.pdf" target="_blank">15 million megapixels</a>).

      <p>A friend did not know about Find/Replace in document editors. Instead of replacing all occurrences of a word she was rereading an assignment. I showed her Find/Replace which not only found every occurrence, including some she had missed, the feature also saved her several minutes. As <a title="see the video on YouTube" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQUfzRF_drc" target="_blank">Kip says</a>, &ldquo;I still love technology! Always and forever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This random tidbit merely illustrates the benefits of being technical / surrounding yourself with technical people. Work smarter, not harder!</p>

<p>For anyone that does not know, most word processors and text editors (Google Docs, Microsoft Word, Open Office Writer, etc) have a feature that lets you find words and phrases matching your input. You can even replace the words and phrases. This functionality can save hours if you want to alter the style of a document, for example adding two spaces after a period. Find a period followed by a space, replace it with a period followed by two spaces. You can get fancier with <a title="chock full of information about regex" href="http://www.regular-expressions.info/" target="_blank">regular expressions</a>, but this is a start.</p>

      <p>I won&rsquo;t validate the ads by pointing them out, but we can all think of a number of annoying commercials. I suppose the marketeers who generated these wretched pieces truly believe that &ldquo;no press is bad press.&rdquo; Don&rsquo;t focus groups give feedback? I can&rsquo;t imagine anyone seeing such choice pieces of advertising and saying, &ldquo;YEAH! I want to buy X now!&rdquo;</p>

<p>More and more ads are moving online, but no one knows what works in online advertising. I block obnoxious ads online, but allow non-obtrusive, possibly even helpful, ads. Last night Mike and I discussed when we click on Google ads&ndash;and it&rsquo;s not when Google would like us to (i.e. all the time). I have to wonder if I&rsquo;m the standard user or a corner case. What brave new world awaits us with advertising?</p>

<p>By the way, I avoid most ads by using <a title="download firefox!" href="http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/" target="_blank">Firefox</a> with <a title="must have firefox add-on!" href="http://adblockplus.org" target="_blank">Adblock Plus</a>. If you&rsquo;re not already using these two, I&rsquo;d highly recommend it. (More to come later on this subject.) Opera 10 has built in ad-blocking although I don&rsquo;t find it works as well. To augment the service you can use Admuncher (I don&rsquo;t link because they charge a lot) or any other technique described on <a title="Ad filtering article on wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_filtering" target="_blank">wikipedia</a>.</p>

      <p>Where&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s a will, there&rsquo;s a way. And likely, if there&rsquo;s a will, there&rsquo;s money. We&rsquo;ve all felt the effects of spam in our email, but some of you may have never seen the amount of spam posted to blogs. Once a day I have to moderate comments with content similar to that of spam email. While that may not sound like much, I am grossly understating the achievement of finding my blog. Try googling for &ldquo;<a title="google for blog" href="http://www.google.com/search?q=blog" target="_blank">blog</a>&rdquo; and you will not find my site easily.</p>

<p>The level of sophistication necessary to post spam on blogs is very high: <a title="google for seth holloway blog and you still may not find me" href="http://www.google.com/search?q=seth+holloway+blog" target="_blank">find a blog</a>, find a post, click to comment, paste in the spam, click to add the comments, and repeat. Anyone with the skills to do so could be gainfully employed as a programmer. What does it say that some would choose to be spammers instead? Hmmm&hellip;</p>

<p>Truth be told, a lot of spam is created by <a title="wikipedia article -- feed your brain" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Script_kiddies" target="_blank">script kiddies</a> who download an easy-to-use hacking kit and start doing their thing. There&rsquo;s something inherently strange about trusting a stranger to furnish tools specifically for illegal, or at least maligned, activity. For example, <a title="netcraft article on phishing fraud" href="http://news.netcraft.com/archives/2008/01/22/mrbrain_stealing_phish_from_fraudsters.html" target="_blank">this story</a> gives details on how a hacking group released a phishing kit that benefits the original group as much as the script kiddie using the package.</p>

<p>Spam is not going away until we make it unprofitable. Although it is hard to stop, please do the world a favor and stop buying all those penis pills you heard about from the stranger online.</p>

<p>UPDATE: This post was more about my continuing amazement with nefarious people, but <a href="http://www.laneholloway.com" target="_blank">Lane</a> informed me of the <a href="http://akismet.com/" target="_blank">Akismet</a> plugin to fight comment spam which the nice folks at <a href="http://www.wordpress.org" target="_blank">Wordpress</a> talk about <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Combating_Comment_Spam" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>Apparently GUI automation tools are so easy to use that any decent programmer can develop a script to post spam arbitrarily. Very clever. Very cool. Luckily, the counter measure to comment-spam is equally elegant.</p>

<p>Ahhh, and a good chuckle because the first comment on this post was spam&hellip;</p>

      <p>We&rsquo;ve all felt the crunch of deadlines and work piling up,  as we balance the working world and the life we&rsquo;re meant to live. In this busy, always-on environment, I am a big fan of getting things done. I am also open to suggestions. In an effort to improve my productivity I went to the &ldquo;experts&rdquo; that I found online, namely <a title="lifehack - waste time mining for precious little gold" href="http://www.lifehack.org/" target="_blank">lifehack</a>&ndash;a website touting useful resources in personal productivity. However, the official <a title="do not waste your time by checking the lifehack blog =)" href="http://www.sethholloway.com/blog/">lifehack blog</a> fills with overblown, verbose posts like <a title="zzz" href="http://www.lifehack.org/articles/lifehack/big-blokes-in-skirts.html" target="_blank">this one</a> that took me minutes to read and essentially said&hellip; well, nothing.</p>

<p>I prefer the minimalistic approach of <a title="say it in five sentences" href="http://five.sentenc.es/"><a href="http://five.sentenc.es">http://five.sentenc.es</a></a> who practice what they preach. We as information consumers should not support these modern-day Dickens who write like they&rsquo;re paid by the word. Even worse are the wolves-in-sheep-clothing producers who waste your time instead of improving your efficiency. In the interest of not wasting your time, I&rsquo;m done with this rant now.</p>
