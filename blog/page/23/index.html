      <p>Google has a nice writeup on the <a title="Google Future of Mobile" href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2008/09/future-of-mobile.html" target="_blank">future of mobile devices</a> today. The article is aimed squarely at phones which may seem like an odd distinction. Despite the proliferation of mobile devices, phones are important because few handhelds can function as a phone. The Nintendo DS, for example, has WiFi capabilities, but no calling features. Also falling into this category are traditional PDAs, the iPod Touch, the Asus P735. Phones can add the ability to do many things (play games, stream media, chat, and cruise the web) easier than other devices can integrate calling.</p>

<p>Some futurists advocate specialized devices instead of the Swiss Army knife. The best example I&rsquo;ve heard is that a serious photographer will never use an integrated device like a camera phone. However, the average person doesn&rsquo;t seem to care&ndash;there are tons of camera phone pics being published online. Consumers generally decide by voting with their dollars and they&rsquo;re voting for all-in-one devices like the iPhone. The researchers may have a point, but there aren&rsquo;t many research articles that are as easy to read as the Google description :)</p>

<p>No matter where the market goes, I&rsquo;m happy to be part of such a promising field! Horray for mobile computing!</p>

<p>Oh, if you&rsquo;re wondering why Google would care, check out the <a title="Google Android" href="http://code.google.com/android/" target="_blank">Google-backed open handset initiative</a>, <a title="Wikipedia Android" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Android" target="_blank">Android</a>, which debuts this week.</p>

      <p>The Students in Software Engineering continue to go strong! Yesterday we had our third meeting where PhD candidate Chris Jones discussed his work on team formation in dynamic, contractless environments. The talk drew a crowd and inspired a great discussion. Personally, I&rsquo;m proud and glad to have Chris at UT, and I look forward to following his progress.</p>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/countrys-real-name/">Country&#8217;s &#8220;real&#8221; name</a></h1>
      <p>I&rsquo;ve been wondering why we do not call a country by the name that the country calls itself? For example, <a title="wikipedia japan" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan" target="_blank">Japan</a> would be &ldquo;<span lang="ja" xml:lang="ja">??</span> Nihon or Nippon<sup><a title="Help:Japanese" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Japanese"><span class="t nihongo icon" style="padding: 0pt 0.1em; color: #0000ee; font-family: sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: bold; font-size: 80%; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal; text-decoration: none;"></span></a></sup>&rdquo;;<a title="google maps of Spain" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=spain+map&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=utf-8" target="_blank"> Spain</a> would be &ldquo;España&rdquo;; and <a title="CIA world factbook" href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/gm.html" target="_blank">Germany </a>would be &ldquo;Deutschland&rdquo;.</p>

<p>I think using the country&rsquo;s internal name would engender a sense of community and increase cultural understanding. It could also help people to learn a new language because we would be exposed to more sounds than we are now.</p>

<p>The only problem I see is in countries with multiple languages (think India), there may be a number of internal names. However, if people would take the time to learn the name of your country, you may be more motivated to come up with an official name.</p>

<p>Good idea? Bad idea? Am I missing something?</p>

      <p>Friday (September 5) marked the kickoff of the Students in Software Engineering (SSE), an organization that I started with my labmate and friend, Justin Enderle. The idea for the organization started in spring 2008 during Software Engineering faculty candidate interviews. As a newer student Justin did not know his peers sitting around the table. In a relatively small department like Software Engineering, the students should know one another.</p>

<p>We started sowing the seeds this summer. Our goal was simple: unite the students in Software Engineering. However, formalizing that goal and deciding how to proceed has involved a great deal of work. We had numerous meetings with EDGE assistant director, Rick Scott, as well as our adviser, Dr. Christine Julien, as we hammered out the kinks. I&rsquo;m extremely proud of our progress!</p>

<p>After a great deal of effort and a lot of lessons learned, we were able to launch successfully! Our first meeting featured a mix of sodas and water, lots of Domino&rsquo;s pizza, and a talk by the always awesome Dr. Christine Julien. We had 31 students and 3 faculty from the Software Engineering track in attendance. Our favorite oracle, Rick Scott, also showed up&ndash;woot!</p>

<p>In addition to a strong turnout and positive feedback, the organization gained two excellent new officers: Dave DeAngelis and Robert Grant. With the extra help the organization is stronger than ever, and Justin and I should be able to continue doing our jobs&ndash;researching :)</p>

<p>Overall, I am very pleased with our first meeting and our general progress. I&rsquo;ve learned a lot about starting an organization, marketing your brand, managing people, and being a constructive, productive audience member. I look forward to future lessons-learned and organizational successes!</p>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/half-price-books/">Half Price Books</a></h1>
      <p>It&rsquo;s no doubt that I love <a title="official website" href="http://www.halfpricebooks.com/" target="_blank">Half Price Books</a> as much as the next guy: they have a great selection, (relatively) clean store, friendly employees, and convenient locations. However, this wonderful store does not have an inventory system. When you ask the friendly employee in the clean, convenient location if they have the new <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Dora the Explorer</span> <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Harry Potter</span> Arnold <span>Schwarzenegger</span> book, they can only tell you where they think it would be located. There&rsquo;s no definitive, &ldquo;Oh, yes! We have that!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The whole situation is odd since books are easier to track than many other physical goods&ndash;they have barcodes and unique identification numbers. As I understand it, all businesses have to take physical inventory periodically. If anyone in the Half Price Books organization knows what they have on hand, why not open the database for use? My guess is that they probably capture a lot of business from people browsing. A couple weeks ago we went in to get one specific book and walked out with five others that we found along the way. It&rsquo;s unclear whether or not we would have bought the other books without the necessary browsing.</p>

<p>Integrating a search feature into the website would also be handy. I understand that companies should stick to what they&rsquo;re good at, and Half Price Books has done well so far; however, opening the inventory system to search would be a straightforward task that would easily put Half Price Books ahead the elite booksellers.</p>

      <p>I&rsquo;m a big fan of the Google suite of products. I&rsquo;ve been connecting via <a title="https on wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Https" target="_blank">https</a> for a while now, but Google has now made it easier. There&rsquo;s a <a title="Encrypt your Gmail!" href="http://www.webmonkey.com/blog/Why_You_Should_Turn_Gmail_s_SSL_Feature_On_Now" target="_blank">great article on Wired</a> about encrypting your Gmail. Anyone using the Google services should do this immediately. Here&rsquo;s a quick how-to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Log in to Gmail (<a title="GMAIL!" href="https://mail.google.com/mail/" target="_blank"><a href="https://mail.google.com/mail/">https://mail.google.com/mail/</a></a>)</li>
<li>In Gmail, click on &ldquo;Settings&rdquo; in the top right corner (beside your username).</li>
<li>Scroll to the &ldquo;Browser connection&rdquo; section at the bottom of the page</li>
<li>Click the radio button for &ldquo;Always use https&rdquo;</li>
<li>Click the &ldquo;Save changes: button at the bottom of the page</li>
<li>Profit</li>

      <p>Over the past six months I have been getting roughly one call per day from random 800 numbers from all over the country. The voice changes, but the message is always the same: &lsquo;This is the second notice that your car warranty is about to expire.&rsquo;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve spoken to other people who are also getting the calls. A friend of mine just bought a car and is receiving these ominous messages which cannot be true.</p>

<p>The worst part is that I&rsquo;m on the <a title="block phone spam" href="https://www.donotcall.gov/" target="_blank">National Do Not Call Registry</a> which should protect me from these unwanted phone calls. Does anyone know of a class action lawsuit against the filth behind these calls? Does anyone know how to file a class action lawsuit&hellip;</p>

<p>Edit: Thanks for pointing out the typo Jason :)</p>

      <p>After watching Sicko I have been more interested in the American health care situation. I don&rsquo;t trust the government to provide high-quality health care coverage. Moore speaks highly of the English system, but a common perk for jobs in the UK (<a title="effects on Brits who choose private health care" href="http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/tax-advice/income-tax/article.html?in_article_id=408244&amp;in_page_id=77" target="_blank">private health care coverage</a>) suggests that the system is less than perfect. Benefits of America&rsquo;s quasi-privatized system are a wash: a person can receive care, but insurance rarely covers the entire cost of operations and medicine. There are a number of other issues at work (governmental regulations, the patent system, market competition, a lack of care for mentally-ill, &hellip;); however, my intent for this post is not to cover any of these complex issues, nor is it to enrage people or debate over the advantages and disadvantages of private health care. Instead, I simply want to share a solution that I find very clever and achievable: <a title="LetWalMartFixUSHealthCare" href="http://articles.moneycentral.msn.com/Investing/JubaksJournal/LetWalMartFixUSHealthCare.aspx" target="_blank">Let Wal-Mart Fix American Health Care</a>.</p>

<p>If they can roll back prices on so many everyday products, they should be able to hardball health care providers and pass the savings on to the consumers. I&rsquo;ll worship the Church of Wal-Mart if it saves me any of the $3,600 a year I pay for health care for my family.</p>

      <p>What is the resolution of unaltered human sight? Computers are slowly pushing their capability higher: from 800x600 to 1920x1200 and beyond. I&rsquo;m left wondering &ldquo;When will the screen resolution catch our innate capabilities?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The answer is not simple and estimates differ on the resolution (<a title="acuity, resolution, ...what now?" href="http://www.clarkvision.com/imagedetail/eye-resolution.html" target="_blank">324 megapixel</a>, <a title="deviantart estimate of human resolution" href="http://news.deviantart.com/article/27174/" target="_blank">576 megapixels</a> to <a title="vision" href="http://www.swift.ac.uk/vision.pdf" target="_blank">15 million megapixels</a>). In any case, our eyes will outperform technology for at least another year or two :) That&rsquo;s when genetic engineering can save the day!</p>
