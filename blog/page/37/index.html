      <p>Google has a nice writeup on the <a title="Google Future of Mobile" href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2008/09/future-of-mobile.html" target="_blank">future of mobile devices</a> today. The article is aimed squarely at phones which may seem like an odd distinction. Despite the proliferation of mobile devices, phones are important because few handhelds can function as a phone. The Nintendo DS, for example, has WiFi capabilities, but no calling features. Also falling into this category are traditional PDAs, the iPod Touch, the Asus P735. Phones can add the ability to do many things (play games, stream media, chat, and cruise the web) easier than other devices can integrate calling.</p>

<p>Some futurists advocate specialized devices instead of the Swiss Army knife. The best example I&rsquo;ve heard is that a serious photographer will never use an integrated device like a camera phone. However, the average person doesn&rsquo;t seem to care&mdash;there are tons of camera phone pics being published online. Consumers generally decide by voting with their dollars and they&rsquo;re voting for all-in-one devices like the iPhone. The researchers may have a point, but there aren&rsquo;t many research articles that are as easy to read as the Google description :)</p>

<p>No matter where the market goes, I&rsquo;m happy to be part of such a promising field! Horray for mobile computing!</p>

<p>Oh, if you&rsquo;re wondering why Google would care, check out the <a title="Google Android" href="http://code.google.com/android/" target="_blank">Google-backed open handset initiative</a>, <a title="Wikipedia Android" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Android" target="_blank">Android</a>, which debuts this week.</p>

      <p>We saw Hamlet 2 last night. It was funnier than expected, and I am now a fan of Steve Coogan! I&rsquo;d give Hamlet 2 a 7/10. The rest of the world feels about the same:</p>

<ul>
<li><a title="IMDB Hamlet 2" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1104733/" target="_blank">IMDB</a> gave it a 6.4/10</li>
<li><a title="Rotten Tomatoes Hamlet 2" href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/hamlet_2/" target="_blank">Rotten Tomatoes</a> gave is a 63/100</li>
<li><a title="Metacritic Hamlet 2" href="http://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/hamlet2?q=hamlet%202" target="_blank">Metacritic</a> critics gave it a 5.4/10 while users gave is a 6.5/10</li>

      <p>I get a real kick out of <a title="Sneaky cat!" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muLIPWjks_M " target="_blank">this simple video</a> (via <a title="Geekologie Ninja Cat..." href="http://www.geekologie.com/2008/09/ninja_cat_is_mad_stealthy_will.php" target="_blank">Geekologie</a>). It&rsquo;s a cat is stalking its owner, very sneakily. I have not seen moves like this since <a title="Wikipedia Red Light Green Light" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_light,_green_light" target="_blank">Red Light Green Light</a> in third grade!</p>

<p>My cat doesn&rsquo;t have to be as stealthy&mdash;he has enough mass and strength to overwhelm any phantom he encounters&mdash;but the video is still really cute.</p>

<p>On a somewhat related note, I&rsquo;m told that the kitty is actually an amazing hunter as recent animal psychology research says that prey animals scan for changes in the landscape. The cat&rsquo;s ability to maintain the same posture and be completely still make it an amazing predator. If you&rsquo;re interested in that idea, animals scanning their surroundings is discussed in depth in <a title="Amazon of Book" href="http://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Pictures-Other-Reports-Autism/dp/0679772898" target="_blank">Thinking in Pictures: and Other Reports from My Life with Autism</a>.</p>

      <p>Alaska Governess Palin had <a title="ZDNet coverage" href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/security/?p=1919" target="_blank">her Yahoo mail account hacked</a> recently. The hacker released a screenshot of one email:</p>

<p><a href="http://wikileaks.org/leak/sarah-palin-hack-2008/01.jpg"><img src="http://wikileaks.org/leak/sarah-palin-hack-2008/01.jpg" alt="Palin leaked email" /></a></p>

<p>It is out of context, but Palin seems loyal, friendly, and helpful. I&rsquo;m actually impressed.</p>

<p>I find the attack amusing, but I fear that going after high profile politicians is not the way to achieve anything. The hacker has likely hastened the end of net neutrality and Internet anonymity as politicians clamor for control. For hackers, of course, this is no worry because they&rsquo;re not going to be traced anyway, but it&rsquo;s bad for the rest of us.</p>

      <p>So the <a title="Interesting read on Lehman Bros" href="http://blogs.moneycentral.msn.com/topstocks/archive/2008/09/15/fed-to-wall-street-drop-dead.aspx" target="_blank">Feds let Lehman Bros fail</a>, but they&rsquo;re willing to <a title="Fed bails out AIG" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=a6QAz6YiyRAI&amp;refer=home" target="_blank">bail out AIG</a>? That must be frustrating for people at Lehman Bros! It is true that punishment was long overdo for Wall Street powermongerers, but we are all suffering for their sins.</p>

<p>This train of thought is new to me. Whenever the market started to go south (earlier this year), I was glad that the free market was punishing people who played fast and loose with other people&rsquo;s money. With house prices down and banks starting to falter, the dream of home ownership seemed within reach for me. The bad guys got hurt, and I could get onto the property ladder.</p>

<p>A sage accountant friend pointed out that we are all tied together, whether we like it or not. With the economy faltering everything is in flux; jobs are scarce, houses aren&rsquo;t worth what you paid for them months ago, and any money you have invested is hurting. My dream exists in a strong economy, not in a financial crisis. As with Enron, these criminals, who cost hard working people millions of dollars, will go (relatively) unpunished. They cannot repay the money because the money is gone; in the down economy they cannot make the money back either. We are defenseless against the devestation.</p>

<p>I am curious to see how the world can recover from such unexpected situations. For now, I withhold judgement and hope that the big brains in economics know what they&rsquo;re doing.</p>

      <p>After <a title="update on bar stool eco" href="http://sethholloway.com/blog/?p=117" target="_blank">misunderstanding</a> the <a title="bar stool economics" href="http://sethholloway.com/blog/?p=115" target="_blank">Bar Stool Economics</a> story, I&rsquo;ve thought about the issue some more.</p>

<p>At first blush, the story is astounding. One group pays 59% while five other groups only have to kick in 1%! To gain a better understanding I <a title="Google Spreadsheet" href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=pICAKzgZ-9PDupCqMjtLQdQ" target="_blank">played with the numbers</a> and got some basic results. Using a flat tax I generated generic income data for 10 aggregate groups as in the Bar Stool &ldquo;lesson.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With a linear distribution of wealth, the top group (10) made 10 times as much as the lowest earning group (1). In this case, the highest earners made 18.18% of all the money and paid 18.18% of all taxes (using the flat tax to simplify the calculations) while the poorest group paid only 1.82% of all taxes.</p>

<p>Whenever we use an exponential distribution of wealth using a growth factor of 2, we get results that are very similar to the Bar Stool&rsquo;s numbers. Whenever the top grossing group outpaces the poorest group by a factor of 512 (2<sup>9</sup>), the highest earners receive a shade over 50% of all income. In this case the lowest five groups make roughly 2% of all the income. Rounding to the nearest dollar, we see that the lowest four groups would basically drink for free.</p>

<p>The Bar Stool Economics story confused me. Now I understand that it is actually a profound musing on the distribution of wealth in America. Simply reduce the gap between rich and poor and no one will have to pay too much ;&ndash;)</p>

<p>Just kidding. Clearly, the disparity between the rich and poor is enormous. For example, CEO of Exxon, Rex, makes <a title="Reuters public data about compensation" href="http://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/companyOfficers?symbol=XOM.N&amp;viewId=comp" target="_blank">16M a year from the company</a>; the guy at Burger King will <a title="Govt stats on minimum wage" href="http://www.dol.gov/esa/whd/flsa/" target="_blank">make about $13K a year</a>. That&rsquo;s a difference of 123077%. That&rsquo;s not unfair; I want in on that gravy train too! But it makes sense that the highest earners will pay the largest percentage of taxes because they make the largest percentage of wealth.</p>

<p>The problem exposed by the Bar Stool Economics story is the progressive nature of the American tax system is unfair. <em>The highest earners are paying a huge percentage of the taxes; a</em>s the <a title="Wikipedia Taxation in the US" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxation_in_the_United_States" target="_blank">Hive Mind</a> tells us &ldquo;<em>&hellip;the top 1% with gross income of $328,049 or more pay 36.9% (earning 19%)&hellip;&rdquo;</em> A flat tax would be a much better system.</p>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/update-bar-stool-economics/">Update: Bar Stool Economics</a></h1>
      <p>So I just received an explanation sans metaphor regarding the <a title="Seth Holloway Bar Stool Economics" href="http://sethholloway.com/blog/?p=115" target="_blank">Bar Stool Economics</a>; my analysis was off. The 10 people represent the US taxpayers broken into buckets by earnings. The top earning 10% (the tenth drinker) pay roughly 70% of the total tax dollars. Whenever the &ldquo;lesson&rdquo; was written, 59% was probably accurate&mdash;we are now more progressive. The bottom 50% of earners are not contributing much to the total pool (3.3% of the total dollars spent), so the bottom 5 drinkers would pay about $4 of the $100 tab in the analogy. The story makes sense; my bad.</p>

<p>Oh, and I didn&rsquo;t mention it specifically but the estate tax sucks.</p>

<p>Also, from my purview, the government will never repeal taxes so taxes will always rise. As such, we should resist any new taxes.</p>

      <p>I received the following story as an email forward. My comments follow after the &ldquo;lesson.&rdquo;</p>

<p>========================================</p>

<p>Bar Stool Economics</p>

<p>Suppose that every day, ten men go out for beer and the bill for all ten comes to $100. If they paid their bill the way we pay our taxes, it would go something like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>The first four men (the poorest) would pay nothing.</li>
<li>The fifth would pay $1.</li>
<li>The sixth would pay $3.</li>
<li>The seventh would pay $7.</li>
<li>The eighth would pay $12.</li>
<li>The ninth would pay $18.</li>
<li>The tenth man (the richest) would pay $59.</li>
</ul>


<p>So, that&rsquo;s what they decided to do. The ten men drank in the bar every day and seemed quite happy with the arrangement, until one day, the owner threw them a curve. &lsquo;Since you are all such good customers, he said, &#8216;I&rsquo;m going to reduce the cost of your daily beer by $20. Drinks for the ten now cost just $80.</p>

<p>The group still wanted to pay their bill the way we pay our taxes so the first four men were unaffected. They would still drink for free. But what about the other six men &ndash; the paying customers? How could they divide the $20 windfall so that everyone would get his &lsquo;fair share?&rsquo; They realized that $20 divided by six is $3.33. But if they subtracted that from everybody&rsquo;s share, then the fifth man and the sixth man would each end up being paid to drink his beer. So, the bar owner suggested that it would be fair to reduce each man&rsquo;s bill by roughly the same amount, and he proceeded to work out the amounts each should pay.</p>

<p>And so:</p>

<ul>
<li>The fifth man, like the first four, now paid nothing (100% savings).</li>
<li>The sixth now paid $2 instead of $3 (33%savings).</li>
<li>The seventh now paid $5 instead of $7 (28%savings).</li>
<li>The eighth now paid $9 instead of $12 (25% savings).</li>
<li>The ninth now paid $14 instead of $18 (22% savings).</li>
<li>The tenth now paid $49 instead of $59 (16% savings).</li>
</ul>


<p>Each of the six was better off than before And the first four continued to drink for free. But once outside the restaurant, the men began to compare their savings.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I only got a dollar out of the $20&rsquo;, declared the sixth man.</p>

<p>He pointed to the tenth man,&lsquo; but he got $10!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yeah, that&rsquo;s right&rsquo;, exclaimed the fifth man. &lsquo;I only saved a dollar, too. It&rsquo;s unfair that he got ten times more than I!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s true!!&rsquo; shouted the seventh man. &lsquo;Why should he get $10 back when I got only two? The wealthy get all the breaks!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Wait a minute,&rsquo; yelled the first four men in unison. &lsquo;We didn&rsquo;t get anything at all. The system exploits the poor!&rsquo;</p>

<p>The nine men surrounded the tenth and beat him up.</p>

<p>The next night the tenth man didn&rsquo;t show up for drinks, so the nine sat down and had beers without him. But when it came time to pay the bill, they discovered something important. They didn&rsquo;t have enough money between all of them for even half of the bill!</p>

<p>And that, boys and girls, journalists and college professors, is how our tax system works. The people who pay the highest taxes get the most benefit from a tax reduction. Tax them too much, attack them for being wealthy, and they just may not show up anymore. In fact, they might start drinking overseas where the atmosphere is somewhat friendlier.</p>

<p>========================================</p>

<p>That cute tale is attributed to <span style="font-family: Courier New; font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">David R. Kamerschen, Ph.D., Professor of Economics, University  of Georgia. However, there are a few things wrong. </span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: Courier New; font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">First, according to <a title="Dr. Kamerschen official page" href="http://davidk.myweb.uga.edu/" target="_blank">his website</a>, &ldquo;&hellip;</span></span>Dr. Kamerschen is <strong>NOT</strong> the author of <em>Tax Cuts: A Simple Lesson in Economics</em>. &rdquo; The email entitled <em>Bar Stool Economics</em> can be found online as <em>Tax Cuts</em>&hellip; Why masquerade as a PhD in Economics? If the author is credible, publish your beliefs and let the community vet the document. This &ldquo;lesson in economics&rdquo; probably wasn&rsquo;t written by a PhD in Economics. I have to question why the author would clamor to Kamerschen for clout&mdash;definitely shady.</p>

<p>Second, the 59% number is bogus. Where does 59% come from? <a title="IRS data for income tax" href="http://www.irs.gov/formspubs/article/0,,id=164272,00.html" target="_blank">Income tax rates</a> in the States top out at 35%. <a title="IRS data for capital gains" href="http://www.irs.gov/newsroom/article/0,,id=106799,00.html" target="_blank">Capital gains taxes</a> in USA top out at 28% and are normally 15%. <a title="IRS data for estate tax" href="http://www.irs.gov/formspubs/article/0,,id=112782,00.html" target="_blank">Estate taxes</a> are around 35% as well. The highest number I found said <a title="About Estate Tax Rates" href="http://beginnersinvest.about.com/od/estatetax/f/estatetaxrate.htm" target="_blank">estate taxes are 55%</a>.</p>

<p>I know that one of the world&rsquo;s richest men, Warren Buffett, openly <a title="Brokaw interviews Buffett" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z_UrOKtjHk" target="_blank">admits</a> to paying a <a title="forbes article" href="http://www.forbes.com/businessinthebeltway/2007/11/14/buffett-taxes-congress-biz-wash-cz_mm_1114buffett.html   " target="_blank">lower tax rate</a>, 17%, than his secretary (33%). All that without a tax advisor. Imagine what you could do if you got a good accountant? Buffett has angered other affluent people by challenging them to <a title="forbes article" href="http://www.forbes.com/businessinthebeltway/forbes/2007/1126/042b.html" target="_blank">admit their tax rate is lower than middle Americans</a>. One of the top three richest people, Warren Buffett, is not paying 59% either; I think it is safe to say the bar stool economics fails the fact check.</p>

<p>What tax or combination of taxes would equate to 59% of the tab? So 59% is not based on tax rate, so maybe it is the tax burden. Looking into that I found several good articles on the distribution of wealth in the US, see <a title="Google Answers" href="http://answers.google.com/answers/threadview?id=2050" target="_blank">Google answers</a>, <a title="Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distribution_of_wealth" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>, and a <a title="UCSC" href="http://sociology.ucsc.edu/whorulesamerica/power/wealth.html" target="_blank">sociology page from UCSC</a>. From the <a title="wikipedia taxation in the USA" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxation_in_the_United_States" target="_blank">hive mind</a>:</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;The data shows the <a title="Progressive tax" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_tax">progressive tax</a> structure of the U.S. federal income tax system on individuals that reduces the <a title="Tax incidence" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_incidence">tax incidence</a> of people with smaller incomes, as they shift the incidence disproportionately to those with higher incomes &ndash; the top 0.1% of taxpayers by income pay 17.4% of federal income taxes (earning 9.1% of the income), the top 1% with gross income of $328,049 or more pay 36.9% (earning 19%), the top 5% with gross income of $137,056 or more pay 57.1% (earning 33.4%), and the bottom 50% with gross income of $30,122 or less pay 3.3% (earning 13.4%).<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxation_in_the_United_States#cite_note-8">[9]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxation_in_the_United_States#cite_note-9">[10]</a></sup> If the federal taxation rate is compared with the <a class="mw-redirect" title="Wealth distribution" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth_distribution">wealth distribution</a> rate, the net wealth (not only income but also including real estate, cars, house, stocks, etc) distribution of the United States does almost coincide with the share of income tax &ndash; the top 1% pay 36.9% of federal tax (wealth 32.7%), the top 5% pay 57.1% (wealth 57.2%), top 10% pay 68% (wealth 69.8%), and the bottom 50% pay 3.3% (wealth 2.8%).<sup id="cite_ref-Kennickell_10-0" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxation_in_the_United_States#cite_note-Kennickell-10">[11]</a>&rdquo;</sup></em> (Look under the <strong>Tax distribution</strong> heading for this information.)</p>

<p>Still no 59%! And, although not much, the bottom four drinkers from the story would have to pay something.</p>

<p>Third, the United States has some of the <a title="Wikipedia tax rates around the world" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_rates_around_the_world" target="_blank">lowest taxes in the world</a>, so rich people fleeing is not as great a concern. If people are leaving the US for tax breaks, they&rsquo;re leaving any country with taxes. If you can get past the impossible immigration laws and handle the radically different culture, UAE, would be perfect for those seeking to escape taxes.</p>

<p>Fourth, the numbers may show that the wealthy have to pay a lot, but rich people manipulate the system. There are a lot of ways to lower your tax burden, from transferring ownership to moving wealth into companies, charities, IRAs, &hellip; Chances are, the effective methods aren&rsquo;t well known so I won&rsquo;t even conjecture how people perform miracles with disappearing money. Whether they reduce their income or the amount of tax they have to pay, rich people can afford to find loopholes and make significant savings.</p>

<p>The above email forward has many flaws, but I believe it makes a good point: our system is complicated and unfair. If I&rsquo;ve missed something, I&rsquo;d love to hear about it.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d like to note that I do not enjoy paying taxes; even as a relatively poor person, I feel I pay too much&mdash;especially considering what I get from the government. I would love a massive overhaul of the system so that everyone could pay less taxes with simplified rules.</p>
