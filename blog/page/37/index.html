      <p>I received the following story as an email forward. My comments follow after the &ldquo;lesson.&rdquo;</p>

<p>========================================</p>

<p>Bar Stool Economics</p>

<p>Suppose that every day, ten men go out for beer and the bill for all ten comes to $100. If they paid their bill the way we pay our taxes, it would go something like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>The first four men (the poorest) would pay nothing.</li>
<li>The fifth would pay $1.</li>
<li>The sixth would pay $3.</li>
<li>The seventh would pay $7.</li>
<li>The eighth would pay $12.</li>
<li>The ninth would pay $18.</li>
<li>The tenth man (the richest) would pay $59.</li>
</ul>


<p>So, that&rsquo;s what they decided to do. The ten men drank in the bar every day and seemed quite happy with the arrangement, until one day, the owner threw them a curve. &lsquo;Since you are all such good customers, he said, &#8216;I&rsquo;m going to reduce the cost of your daily beer by $20. Drinks for the ten now cost just $80.</p>

<p>The group still wanted to pay their bill the way we pay our taxes so the first four men were unaffected. They would still drink for free. But what about the other six men &ndash; the paying customers? How could they divide the $20 windfall so that everyone would get his &lsquo;fair share?&rsquo; They realized that $20 divided by six is $3.33. But if they subtracted that from everybody&rsquo;s share, then the fifth man and the sixth man would each end up being paid to drink his beer. So, the bar owner suggested that it would be fair to reduce each man&rsquo;s bill by roughly the same amount, and he proceeded to work out the amounts each should pay.</p>

<p>And so:</p>

<ul>
<li>The fifth man, like the first four, now paid nothing (100% savings).</li>
<li>The sixth now paid $2 instead of $3 (33%savings).</li>
<li>The seventh now paid $5 instead of $7 (28%savings).</li>
<li>The eighth now paid $9 instead of $12 (25% savings).</li>
<li>The ninth now paid $14 instead of $18 (22% savings).</li>
<li>The tenth now paid $49 instead of $59 (16% savings).</li>
</ul>


<p>Each of the six was better off than before And the first four continued to drink for free. But once outside the restaurant, the men began to compare their savings.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I only got a dollar out of the $20&rsquo;, declared the sixth man.</p>

<p>He pointed to the tenth man,&lsquo; but he got $10!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yeah, that&rsquo;s right&rsquo;, exclaimed the fifth man. &lsquo;I only saved a dollar, too. It&rsquo;s unfair that he got ten times more than I!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s true!!&rsquo; shouted the seventh man. &lsquo;Why should he get $10 back when I got only two? The wealthy get all the breaks!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Wait a minute,&rsquo; yelled the first four men in unison. &lsquo;We didn&rsquo;t get anything at all. The system exploits the poor!&rsquo;</p>

<p>The nine men surrounded the tenth and beat him up.</p>

<p>The next night the tenth man didn&rsquo;t show up for drinks, so the nine sat down and had beers without him. But when it came time to pay the bill, they discovered something important. They didn&rsquo;t have enough money between all of them for even half of the bill!</p>

<p>And that, boys and girls, journalists and college professors, is how our tax system works. The people who pay the highest taxes get the most benefit from a tax reduction. Tax them too much, attack them for being wealthy, and they just may not show up anymore. In fact, they might start drinking overseas where the atmosphere is somewhat friendlier.</p>

<p>========================================</p>

<p>That cute tale is attributed to <span style="font-family: Courier New; font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">David R. Kamerschen, Ph.D., Professor of Economics, University  of Georgia. However, there are a few things wrong. </span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: Courier New; font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">First, according to <a title="Dr. Kamerschen official page" href="http://davidk.myweb.uga.edu/" target="_blank">his website</a>, &ldquo;&hellip;</span></span>Dr. Kamerschen is <strong>NOT</strong> the author of <em>Tax Cuts: A Simple Lesson in Economics</em>. &rdquo; The email entitled <em>Bar Stool Economics</em> can be found online as <em>Tax Cuts</em>&hellip; Why masquerade as a PhD in Economics? If the author is credible, publish your beliefs and let the community vet the document. This &ldquo;lesson in economics&rdquo; probably wasn&rsquo;t written by a PhD in Economics. I have to question why the author would clamor to Kamerschen for clout&mdash;definitely shady.</p>

<p>Second, the 59% number is bogus. Where does 59% come from? <a title="IRS data for income tax" href="http://www.irs.gov/formspubs/article/0,,id=164272,00.html" target="_blank">Income tax rates</a> in the States top out at 35%. <a title="IRS data for capital gains" href="http://www.irs.gov/newsroom/article/0,,id=106799,00.html" target="_blank">Capital gains taxes</a> in USA top out at 28% and are normally 15%. <a title="IRS data for estate tax" href="http://www.irs.gov/formspubs/article/0,,id=112782,00.html" target="_blank">Estate taxes</a> are around 35% as well. The highest number I found said <a title="About Estate Tax Rates" href="http://beginnersinvest.about.com/od/estatetax/f/estatetaxrate.htm" target="_blank">estate taxes are 55%</a>.</p>

<p>I know that one of the world&rsquo;s richest men, Warren Buffett, openly <a title="Brokaw interviews Buffett" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z_UrOKtjHk" target="_blank">admits</a> to paying a <a title="forbes article" href="http://www.forbes.com/businessinthebeltway/2007/11/14/buffett-taxes-congress-biz-wash-cz_mm_1114buffett.html   " target="_blank">lower tax rate</a>, 17%, than his secretary (33%). All that without a tax advisor. Imagine what you could do if you got a good accountant? Buffett has angered other affluent people by challenging them to <a title="forbes article" href="http://www.forbes.com/businessinthebeltway/forbes/2007/1126/042b.html" target="_blank">admit their tax rate is lower than middle Americans</a>. One of the top three richest people, Warren Buffett, is not paying 59% either; I think it is safe to say the bar stool economics fails the fact check.</p>

<p>What tax or combination of taxes would equate to 59% of the tab? So 59% is not based on tax rate, so maybe it is the tax burden. Looking into that I found several good articles on the distribution of wealth in the US, see <a title="Google Answers" href="http://answers.google.com/answers/threadview?id=2050" target="_blank">Google answers</a>, <a title="Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distribution_of_wealth" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>, and a <a title="UCSC" href="http://sociology.ucsc.edu/whorulesamerica/power/wealth.html" target="_blank">sociology page from UCSC</a>. From the <a title="wikipedia taxation in the USA" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxation_in_the_United_States" target="_blank">hive mind</a>:</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;The data shows the <a title="Progressive tax" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_tax">progressive tax</a> structure of the U.S. federal income tax system on individuals that reduces the <a title="Tax incidence" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_incidence">tax incidence</a> of people with smaller incomes, as they shift the incidence disproportionately to those with higher incomes &ndash; the top 0.1% of taxpayers by income pay 17.4% of federal income taxes (earning 9.1% of the income), the top 1% with gross income of $328,049 or more pay 36.9% (earning 19%), the top 5% with gross income of $137,056 or more pay 57.1% (earning 33.4%), and the bottom 50% with gross income of $30,122 or less pay 3.3% (earning 13.4%).<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxation_in_the_United_States#cite_note-8">[9]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxation_in_the_United_States#cite_note-9">[10]</a></sup> If the federal taxation rate is compared with the <a class="mw-redirect" title="Wealth distribution" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth_distribution">wealth distribution</a> rate, the net wealth (not only income but also including real estate, cars, house, stocks, etc) distribution of the United States does almost coincide with the share of income tax &ndash; the top 1% pay 36.9% of federal tax (wealth 32.7%), the top 5% pay 57.1% (wealth 57.2%), top 10% pay 68% (wealth 69.8%), and the bottom 50% pay 3.3% (wealth 2.8%).<sup id="cite_ref-Kennickell_10-0" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxation_in_the_United_States#cite_note-Kennickell-10">[11]</a>&rdquo;</sup></em> (Look under the <strong>Tax distribution</strong> heading for this information.)</p>

<p>Still no 59%! And, although not much, the bottom four drinkers from the story would have to pay something.</p>

<p>Third, the United States has some of the <a title="Wikipedia tax rates around the world" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_rates_around_the_world" target="_blank">lowest taxes in the world</a>, so rich people fleeing is not as great a concern. If people are leaving the US for tax breaks, they&rsquo;re leaving any country with taxes. If you can get past the impossible immigration laws and handle the radically different culture, UAE, would be perfect for those seeking to escape taxes.</p>

<p>Fourth, the numbers may show that the wealthy have to pay a lot, but rich people manipulate the system. There are a lot of ways to lower your tax burden, from transferring ownership to moving wealth into companies, charities, IRAs, &hellip; Chances are, the effective methods aren&rsquo;t well known so I won&rsquo;t even conjecture how people perform miracles with disappearing money. Whether they reduce their income or the amount of tax they have to pay, rich people can afford to find loopholes and make significant savings.</p>

<p>The above email forward has many flaws, but I believe it makes a good point: our system is complicated and unfair. If I&rsquo;ve missed something, I&rsquo;d love to hear about it.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d like to note that I do not enjoy paying taxes; even as a relatively poor person, I feel I pay too much&mdash;especially considering what I get from the government. I would love a massive overhaul of the system so that everyone could pay less taxes with simplified rules.</p>

      <p>On the subject of <a title="sethholloway.com learn a new language" href="http://sethholloway.com/blog/?p=87" target="_blank">languages</a>, I&rsquo;ve been wondering why we do not call a country by the name that the country calls itself? For example, <a title="wikipedia japan" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan" target="_blank">Japan</a> would be &ldquo;<span lang="ja" xml:lang="ja">??</span> Nihon or Nippon<sup><a title="Help:Japanese" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Japanese"><span class="t nihongo icon" style="padding: 0pt 0.1em; color: #0000ee; font-family: sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: bold; font-size: 80%; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal; text-decoration: none;"></span></a></sup>&rdquo;;<a title="google maps of Spain" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=spain+map&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=utf-8" target="_blank"> Spain</a> would be &ldquo;España&rdquo;; and <a title="CIA world factbook" href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/gm.html" target="_blank">Germany </a>would be &ldquo;Deutschland&rdquo;.</p>

<p>I think using the country&rsquo;s internal name would engender a sense of community and increase cultural understanding. It could also help people to learn a new language because we would be exposed to more sounds than we are now.</p>

<p>The only problem I see is in countries with multiple languages (think India), there may be a number of internal names. However, if people would take the time to learn the name of your country, you may be more motivated to come up with an official name.</p>

<p>Good idea? Bad idea? Am I missing something?</p>

      <p>Andrea and I love language and culture, although she actually has the degrees to back it up. We love to travel and see how other people live. I ask people about their native tongues; by doing so I&rsquo;ve learned how to say &ldquo;hello&rdquo; in about 15 languages. In the future I&rsquo;d like to beef up my vocabulary more. To do so, I&rsquo;ve found a couple sites with free language education: <a title="BBC Languages" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/languages/" target="_blank">BBC Languages</a> and <a title="MIT Open Courses on Language" href="http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/web/courses/courses/index.htm#ForeignLanguagesandLiteratures" target="_blank">MIT Open Courses</a>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I have not made time to learn a new language yet, but I&rsquo;d love to hear how other people feel about the sites :)</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re struggling with English and you live in the Austin area, you should talk to <a title="Andrea Mire Linkedin" href="http://www.linkedin.com/profile?viewProfile=&amp;key=29993716" target="_blank">Andrea Holloway</a> about accent modification! She has helped several people to improve their pronounciation and is currently working with <a title="Alison McGregor PhD Linkedin" href="http://www.linkedin.com/profile?viewProfile=&amp;key=7298067" target="_blank">Alison McGregor PhD</a>, an <a title="UT ESL Faculty" href="http://www.utexas.edu/student/esl/faculty/" target="_blank">expert </a>on accent modification.</p>

      <p>Now that the four most important politicians have given their speeches and the debates have died down, we will get a flood of differing opinions on the upcoming election. First, I was surprised that a celeb gossip site would write about the Veep. Then, I was surprised when a <a title="About Penelope Trunk" href="http://penelopetrunk.com/aboutme.html" target="_blank">middle-aged single mother CEO</a> of a <a title="brazencareerist.com" href="http://www.brazencareerist.com/" target="_self">career advice website</a> wrote about the VP. Penelope Trunk says that <a title="Palin should be a mother first" href="http://blog.penelopetrunk.com/2008/09/04/palins-children-should-take-priority-over-being-vice-president/" target="_blank">Palin is irresponsible and bound for failure</a> based on her family life. The next day Trunk expresses her desire to <a title="How will Palin fare?" href="http://blog.penelopetrunk.com/2008/09/05/i-hope-i-get-to-travel-on-sarah-palins-plane/" target="_blank">see Palin balance the rigors</a> of fame, extreme travel, and motherhood.</p>

<p>In general, it seems that a lot of people are saying Palin is irresponsible. I found a nice story on <a title="Alaskan Local News Coverage" href="http://www.ktuu.com/global/story.asp?s=8194634" target="_blank">Palin&rsquo;s irresponsibility</a>, it turns out she flew to Texas while extremely pregnant. While waiting to give a speech, her water broke. How did she handle it? She gave the speech then got on a 10 hour flight back to Alaska, then went to the hospital and delivered the baby. It&rsquo;s bad enough that she put her baby through hell, but it&rsquo;s worse because she already knew the child had special needs (read, <a title="wikipedia down syndrome" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Down_syndrome" target="_blank">Down Syndrome</a>). I&rsquo;m glad she can get things done, but that&rsquo;s completey irresponsible.</p>

<p>It feels like a lot of people are against the lipsticked-bulldog, so I am interested to see how the debates unfold and where the political coverage goes.</p>

      <p>Let&rsquo;s all have a moment of silence for innovation in America. Bills such as the one just <a title="Techdirt coverage" href="http://techdirt.com/articles/20080911/1804242241.shtml" target="_blank">approved by the Senate</a> are quickly stifling America&rsquo;s ability to compete in a global economy. We&rsquo;re worried about all the wrong issues! While America clings to power brokers of yesteryear, the rest of the world is evolving at a breakneck speed, generating new ideas and embracing new technologies. Very frustrating!</p>

<p>This comes on the heels of news about <a title="Techdirt coverage" href="http://techdirt.com/articles/20080911/0202322232.shtml" target="_blank">84 students having their GMAT scores revoked</a> because the offending students wrote what they remember from the GMAT on a web forum, and <a title="Techdirt coverage" href="http://techdirt.com/articles/20080911/0352222239.shtml" target="_blank">more Draconian crap from Disney</a>.</p>

<p>The former story feels incredibly petty on the part of Graduate Management Admission Council (creators of the GMAT)&mdash;a pure power struggle. There is a whole industry built around providing a realistic testing experience before you take the test. Whenever I registered for the GRE I was mailed the PowerPrep software for free. PowerPrep is two full GRE tests that you can take to prepare for the real deal. That&rsquo;s in addition to the test book I had. The test book I bought bragged about being realistic. How are these practice tests and test preparation books created if not by recalling information about the test after taking it? Count this as a loss for the good guys.</p>

<p>As for Disney&rsquo;s proposal that filesharers should be banned from the Internet&hellip; wow. Following this scheme you would ban 80% of users within the first month. The other 20% would catch up soon thereafter. There are so many problems with the idea! For example, visit any web forum and you will find &ldquo;illegal&rdquo; content from images and videos to user guides and DRM circumvention methods. And that&rsquo;s just a help forum. God forbid you find one of the many sites that allow for anonymous posting. Say we do ban people, then what? Once you&rsquo;re &ldquo;banned&rdquo; how would we prevent the numerous unsecured ways to get online? No country successfully defends its own borders; the Internet only amplifies the number of issues.</p>

<p>The Internet is no longer a privelege, it&rsquo;s a right. We rely on the Internet for help, fun, and education both personally and professionally. We expect ubiquitous access, at worst we have to pay&mdash;think airplanes offering Wi-Fi. I shed a year for the future given our current course. Don&rsquo;t stand in the way of progress. We need educated people to discuss the Internet and how best to satisfy the stakeholder.</p>

      <p>Last night I caught about 5 minutes of the <a title="Spike online" href="http://www.spike.com/network/spike" target="_blank">Spike</a> show <a title="Manswers " href="http://www.spike.com/group/manswers" target="_blank">Manswers</a> (potentially NSFW) and they asked, &ldquo;How long could you survive in space without a spacesuit?&rdquo; The correct answer was 1.5 minutes. According to Manswers, no human has ever been subjected to space without a suit; however, astronauts did throw dogs into the void of space &ldquo;for science.&rdquo; Surprisingly, pooches do not fare any better than we humans do.</p>

<p>What Manswers didn&rsquo;t mention was <a title="wikipedia water bears" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tardigrada" target="_blank">water bears</a>, or Tardigrade. Tardigrade are eight-legged animals about <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">1cm</span> 2mm long that live in water. These strange little creatures are all over the place, but I don&rsquo;t remember learning about them in school. I wish I had because Tardigrade are freaks of nature! They make Biology sound interesting ;)</p>

<p>From the wikipedia article: &ldquo;Tardigrades are able to survive in extreme environments that would kill almost any other animal. Some can survive temperatures close to absolute zero<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tardigrada#cite_note-3">[4]</a></sup>, temperatures as high as 151°C (303°F), 1,000 times more radiation than any other animal<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tardigrada#cite_note-4">[5]</a></sup>, nearly a decade without water, and even the vacuum of space.<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tardigrada#cite_note-5">[6]</a></sup>&rdquo;</p>

<p>I actually found out about water bears through an interesting article on Wired, <a title="Wired.com article on water cows" href="http://blog.wired.com/wiredscience/2008/09/invertebrate-as.html" target="_blank">Invertebrate Astronauts Make Space History</a>, about water bears surviving in space without any protection. Basically, scientists put Tardigrade in a box, strapped it to a satellite, and let the little guys orbit the Earth. The water bears survived based on amazing biological processes like 1) slowing their metabolism down to 1/10,000 the normal rate and 2) repairing cellular damage caused by cosmic radiation. One day, scientists may even know how water bears do it; until then, bask in the glory of Tardigrade:

<p>If you look closely you&rsquo;ll see the little guy is smiling. We can only assume he&rsquo;s saying, &ldquo;I am biologically superior to billions of other species!</p>

      <p>This is a quick post simply to get the word out because I&rsquo;m not seeing much about this story today despite it&rsquo;s potentially large ramifications. <a title="lane holloway is awesome" href="http://www.laneholloway.com" target="_blank">Lane</a> passed along the news that <a title="MSN coverage of &quot;The Death of OPEC&quot;" href="http://blogs.moneycentral.msn.com/topstocks/archive/2008/09/11/the-death-of-opec.aspx" target="_blank">Saudi Arabia has walked out on talks with OPEC</a>. Apparently, they are tired of Hugo Chavez and Iran. The Saudis are pledging to fill the world&rsquo;s oil needs. While good for the consumer right now, I&rsquo;m not sure how this will effect the world. The MSN story may be making a mountain out of a molehill&mdash;I&rsquo;m interested to hear more as the situation unfolds.</p>

      <p>On my bike ride in ths morning I was thinking about weather <a title="Seth Holloway Aug 09, 2008 Post" href="http://sethholloway.com/blog/?p=102" target="_blank">again</a>. While getting ready this morning I had the TV on. I would do a task then check the TV&mdash;no weather&mdash;so I&rsquo;d do another task and check the TV&mdash;still no weather. All the while the news icon is taunting me in the bottom left corner of the screen. The simple graphic states the affiliate name and the temperature in a given area. Fox, NBC, CBS, ABC, and News 8 Austin were all roughtly the same icon. Why not put an umbrella sign if it is likely to rain?</p>

<p>Seriously. Augment the current graphic with an unobtrusive umbrella icon. Simple. Clean. Efficient. Helpful. Personally, I would still have the channel on for a few minutes each morning, so the channels do not need to worry about ratings. If anything, I&rsquo;d watch the channel more often because they would reliably give me the information I wanted. except I would leave the house more informed and happier. I can dream!</p>

      <p>I started riding my bike to campus this summer (started around May 2008). In the few months since then I have learned to pay more attention to the weather and my departure time. Beyond clear skies and moderate temperatures I treasure fewer cars on the road, adequate ambient light, and green traffic signals!</p>

<p>I saved the best for last: I want low humidity! This morning Austin is around 90% humidity and the ride into campus was miserable&mdash;despite moderate temperatures. With high humidity the body cannot cool off properly and it feels like you&rsquo;re pedaling through a swimming pool.</p>

<p>And since I&rsquo;m talking about weather, I&rsquo;d like to share a couple cool sites I found recently. <a title="umbrellatoday.com" href="http://umbrellatoday.com/" target="_blank">Umbrellatoday</a> simplifies the weather interface and simply tells you whether or not you need an umbrella. Contrast that to the <a title="weather.com" href="http://www.weather.com/outlook/health/allergies/local/78757?lswe=78757&amp;lwsa=Weather36HourAllergiesCommand&amp;from=searchbox" target="_blank">weather.com page</a>; I see graphics, radar images, a lot of text, multiple different colors, and several days worth of forecasts. I just need to know if it will rain today so I can make an informed choice about riding my bike versus taking the bus, and Umbrellatoday comes to my rescue.</p>

<p>Another site that keeps it simple is <a title="Stormpulse.com" href="http://www.stormpulse.com/" target="_blank">Stormpulse</a>, an excellent source for tropical storm information. Contrast the Stormpulse interface to the <a title="Stormtracker on NOAA" href="http://www.stormtracker.noaa.gov/" target="_blank">official government storm tracking website</a>. There are times when I want to find out about weather events without wading through all the other stuff (think <a title="cnn.com" href="http://wwww.cnn.com/" target="_blank">cnn.com</a>); Stormpulse is perfect in those situations.</p>

<p>Note: both sites are still new to me (and the world in general, I think). We&rsquo;ll see how accurate and reliable they are. As always, your mileage may vary.</p>

      <p>I found a link for the <a title="Quicken Spare Change Challenge" href="http://quicken.intuit.com/personal-finance-tips/quiz-spare-change-challenge-money-management.jsp" target="_blank">Quicken Spare Change Challenge</a>. The 42 questions are pretty obvious, which is sad because according to their calculator, I waste $556 a month! To be honest, there were a few items that I did not think much of, but I suppose that is the nature of savings: every bit counts.</p>

<p>I encourage you to take the quick quiz and see if there&rsquo;s anything wasteful that you&rsquo;re not aware of.</p>

<p>And in parting, one of my favorite pieces of advice: &ldquo;Waste not, want not!&rdquo;</p>
