      <p>Because college <a title="seth holloway dot com college football is big business" href="http://sethholloway.com/blog/?p=331" target="_blank">football is big business</a>, it is big news that UT Defensive Coordinator <a title="wikipedia Will Muschamp" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Muschamp" target="_blank">Will Muschamp</a> is next in line for <a title="Daily Texan" href="http://www.dailytexanonline.com/football_muschamp_seals_future_in_texas" target="_blank">head coach at UT</a>. This is good news because it shows that Texas football will promote high achieving individuals, and Muschamp is a talented spitfire.</p>

<p>I predict that <a title="Mack Brown" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mack_Brown" target="_blank">Mack Brown</a> and <a title="Colt McCoy" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colt_McCoy" target="_blank">Colt McCoy</a> will stick around until next year when UT wins the national championship and Colt wins <a title="Heisman Trophy" href="http://www.heisman.com/" target="_blank">Heisman</a>. Mack will then step down and Muschamp will take over the championship team.</p>

      <p>Earlier this year <a title="seth holloway free the airwaves" href="http://sethholloway.com/blog/?p=253" target="_blank">I talked about freeing the airwaves</a>. On election day the FCC unanimously agreed to open the bits of the spectrum between broadcast TV channels to anyone. If you haven&rsquo;t read about it, more information is available on the Google Blog <a title="Google Blog: Airwaves are free" href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2008/11/vote-for-broadband-in-white-spaces.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>So why is this such a big deal? Take a look at the Electromagnetic Spectrum. (Aside: Human reality is everything we can touch, smell, taste, see and hear&mdash;a minuscule portion of the spectrum. We miss out on a lot of the world&rsquo;s wonders.) Notice the massive amount of spectrum devoted to radio and TV.</p>

<p><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8a/Electromagnetic-Spectrum.png"><img title="Electromagnetic Spectrum" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8a/Electromagnetic-Spectrum.png" alt="Electromagnetic Spectrum from Wikipedia" width="350" /></a></p>

<p>Looking at this band in more detail we see a complicated mess.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nab.org/AM/images/images/xertimages/scitech/Spectrum%20Allocation.gif"><img title="US Spectrum Allocation" src="http://www.nab.org/AM/images/images/xertimages/scitech/Spectrum%20Allocation.gif" alt="US Spectrum Allocation (from www.nab.org)" width="426" /></a></p>

<p>Full version available <a href="http://www.ntia.doc.gov/osmhome/allochrt.pdf" target="_blank">here as a pdf</a>.</p>

<p>Radio and TV used to be the only devices in this space, but the way we live our lives is changing and the spectrum allocations should too. The FCC has taken a step in the right direction, although I hope we continue to open the spectrum and allow innovation in the whitespaces to flourish.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m impressed with not only his skills, but the fact that he took time to learn a useless instrument.

      <p>I came across a website that <a title="Obama CTO" href="http://obamacto.org/" target="_blank">tallies votes on technological ideas that the Obama CTO</a> will hopefully take to heart. I like the voting scheme employed; you&rsquo;re given 10 votes and you can give up to three votes per idea&mdash;kind of like the <a title="wikipedia Condorcet" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet_method" target="_blank">Condorcet voting method</a> <a title="seth holloway dot com comments" href="http://sethholloway.com/blog/?p=205" target="_blank">I learned about</a> during this presidential election.</p>

<p>I agreed with the top three choices (net neutrality, repeal the patriot act, and repeal the DMCA), so these received one vote each. I also put one point into restoring DARPA because I&rsquo;m a fan of futuristic research that may have no commercial impacts for years to come. I put three votes towards more research into energy and rethinking IP law because those are two of my biggest technological pet peeves.</p>

<p>The site has a lot of good ideas, although I would like to see more about security. All the money and technology in the world will be useless if we do not have control of our own machines. America has criminalized hacking rather than studying it; without knowledge of hacking, how can we stop it?</p>

<p>I would also like to see more push for improving technological infrastructure so that America can continue to compete in the future. We know the theory, but other nations are actually implementing these cool ideas.</p>

<p>In your opinion is the site missing any good ideas? Where did you put your 10 votes?</p>

      <p>I&rsquo;ve previously wondered if <a title="wikipedia AIDS" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIDS" target="_blank">AIDS</a> and <a title="wikiepedia leukemia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia" target="_blank">Leukemia</a> would cancel each other out. That may not make sense on the surface, but AIDS attacks <a title="wikipedia C4 T cells" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_helper_cell" target="_blank">C4</a> T cells, which are <a title="wikipedia lymphocyte" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphocytes" target="_blank">lymphocytes</a>, and Leukemia is an unchecked proliferation of <a title="wikipedia Leukocytes" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukocytes" target="_blank">leukocytes</a> (white blood cells) which includes lymphocytes. In my uneducated estimation, the excess of white blood cells produced by Leukemia could be enough to counteract the white blood cells killed by AIDS.</p>

<p>Apparently this does not work. An American living in Berlin had AIDS and Leukemia simultaneously. The patient is notable because he has been <a title="Wired.com article on AIDS treatment" href="http://news.wired.com/dynamic/stories/E/EU_MED_AIDS_TREATMENT" target="_blank">&ldquo;cured&rdquo; of AIDS</a> after receiving a bone marrow transplant. The  article does not mention whether or not Leukemia is cured, but I assume it is. We definitely need to step up research on genes and stem cells!</p>

      <p>As a Texan, I know <a title="American Football" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Football" target="_blank">football</a> (American football, not soccer) is serious business. But whenever I say it, I am half joking. I grew up playing football; I went to a high school where athletics were a big deal; and now, my university <a title="Mack Brown Texas Football" href="http://www.mackbrown-texasfootball.com/" target="_blank">makes a big deal about football</a>. (UT does have a <a title="UT rankings" href="http://rivals.yahoo.com/ncaa/football/polls" target="_blank">great football program</a>, although I&rsquo;d love to see research get some of those mega bucks&mdash;but that&rsquo;s a different story entirely). I say, &ldquo;I am half joking&rdquo; because I know how serious football is, but I lament that shows (like <a title="Wikipedia Friday Night Lights" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friday_Night_Lights_(TV_series)" target="_blank">Friday Night Lights)</a> depict Texans as hat-wearing, beer-swilling cowboys who live for weekend football. We&rsquo;re not all like that :)</p>

<p>And now that I&rsquo;ve said my piece about football in Texas&hellip; here&rsquo;s the story that inspired the post in the first place: A <a title="LSU-Bama argument leads to death" href="http://msn.foxsports.com/cfb/story/8777938/Cops:-Ala.-LSU-argument-led-to-two-deaths" target="_blank">couple was killed</a> over an argument over last week&rsquo;s intense football game between LSU and Alabama. Alabama, one of the top teams in the nation, won in overtime. Some taunting between fans led to gunfire and two people dying. Sadly, college football is serious business.</p>

      <p><a title="Seth Holloway I Hate Being Sick" href="http://sethholloway.com/blog/?p=329" target="_blank">Yesterday</a>, I felt terrible. Today, I&rsquo;m recovering nicely. I may even be able to leave the house tomorrow!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure what did me in, although I&rsquo;ve considered an infection from my biking accident or residual effects of the flu shot. Ultimately, I think it was just a stomach bug that hit while my body was weakened.</p>
