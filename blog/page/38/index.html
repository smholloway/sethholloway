      <p>On my bike ride in ths morning I was thinking about weather <a title="Seth Holloway Aug 09, 2008 Post" href="http://sethholloway.com/blog/?p=102" target="_blank">again</a>. While getting ready this morning I had the TV on. I would do a task then check the TV&mdash;no weather&mdash;so I&rsquo;d do another task and check the TV&mdash;still no weather. All the while the news icon is taunting me in the bottom left corner of the screen. The simple graphic states the affiliate name and the temperature in a given area. Fox, NBC, CBS, ABC, and News 8 Austin were all roughtly the same icon. Why not put an umbrella sign if it is likely to rain?</p>

<p>Seriously. Augment the current graphic with an unobtrusive umbrella icon. Simple. Clean. Efficient. Helpful. Personally, I would still have the channel on for a few minutes each morning, so the channels do not need to worry about ratings. If anything, I&rsquo;d watch the channel more often because they would reliably give me the information I wanted. except I would leave the house more informed and happier. I can dream!</p>

      <p>I started riding my bike to campus this summer (started around May 2008). In the few months since then I have learned to pay more attention to the weather and my departure time. Beyond clear skies and moderate temperatures I treasure fewer cars on the road, adequate ambient light, and green traffic signals!</p>

<p>I saved the best for last: I want low humidity! This morning Austin is around 90% humidity and the ride into campus was miserable&mdash;despite moderate temperatures. With high humidity the body cannot cool off properly and it feels like you&rsquo;re pedaling through a swimming pool.</p>

<p>And since I&rsquo;m talking about weather, I&rsquo;d like to share a couple cool sites I found recently. <a title="umbrellatoday.com" href="http://umbrellatoday.com/" target="_blank">Umbrellatoday</a> simplifies the weather interface and simply tells you whether or not you need an umbrella. Contrast that to the <a title="weather.com" href="http://www.weather.com/outlook/health/allergies/local/78757?lswe=78757&amp;lwsa=Weather36HourAllergiesCommand&amp;from=searchbox" target="_blank">weather.com page</a>; I see graphics, radar images, a lot of text, multiple different colors, and several days worth of forecasts. I just need to know if it will rain today so I can make an informed choice about riding my bike versus taking the bus, and Umbrellatoday comes to my rescue.</p>

<p>Another site that keeps it simple is <a title="Stormpulse.com" href="http://www.stormpulse.com/" target="_blank">Stormpulse</a>, an excellent source for tropical storm information. Contrast the Stormpulse interface to the <a title="Stormtracker on NOAA" href="http://www.stormtracker.noaa.gov/" target="_blank">official government storm tracking website</a>. There are times when I want to find out about weather events without wading through all the other stuff (think <a title="cnn.com" href="http://wwww.cnn.com/" target="_blank">cnn.com</a>); Stormpulse is perfect in those situations.</p>

<p>Note: both sites are still new to me (and the world in general, I think). We&rsquo;ll see how accurate and reliable they are. As always, your mileage may vary.</p>

The 42 questions are pretty obvious, which is sad because according to their calculator, I waste $556 a month! To be honest, there were a few items that I did not think much of, but I suppose that is the nature of savings: every bit counts.</p>

<p>I encourage you to take the quick quiz and see if there&rsquo;s anything wasteful that you&rsquo;re not aware of.</p>

<p>And in parting, one of my favorite pieces of advice: &ldquo;Waste not, want not!&rdquo;</p>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/the-students-in-software-engineering/">The Students in Software Engineering</a></h1>
      <p>Friday (September 5) marked the kickoff of the Students in Software Engineering (SSE), an organization that I started with my labmate and friend, Justin Enderle. The idea for the organization started in spring 2008 during Software Engineering faculty candidate interviews. As a newer student Justin did not know his peers sitting around the table. In a relatively small department like Software Engineering, the students should know one another.</p>

<p>We started sowing the seeds this summer. Our goal was simple: unite the students in Software Engineering. However, formalizing that goal and deciding how to proceed has involved a great deal of work. We had numerous meetings with EDGE assistant director, Rick Scott, as well as our adviser, Dr. Christine Julien, as we hammered out the kinks. I&rsquo;m extremely proud of our progress!</p>

<p>After a great deal of effort and a lot of lessons learned, we were able to launch successfully! Our first meeting featured a mix of sodas and water, lots of Domino&rsquo;s pizza, and a talk by the always awesome Dr. Christine Julien. We had 31 students and 3 faculty from the Software Engineering track in attendance. Our favorite oracle, Rick Scott, also showed up&mdash;woot!</p>

<p>In addition to a strong turnout and positive feedback, the organization gained two excellent new officers: Dave DeAngelis and Robert Grant. With the extra help the organization is stronger than ever, and Justin and I should be able to continue doing our jobs&mdash;researching :)</p>

<p>Overall, I am very pleased with our first meeting and our general progress. I&rsquo;ve learned a lot about starting an organization, marketing your brand, managing people, and being a constructive, productive audience member. I look forward to future lessons-learned and organizational successes!</p>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/mccain-says-i-am-not-a-robot/">McCain says, &#8220;I am not a robot&#8221;</a></h1>
      <p>McCain gave his acceptance speech at Thursday night&rsquo;s RNC. The first thing I noticed was how stiff he was: his shoulders crooked and hunched, his arms hung languidly at his sides. He walked out and started his speech. For over 30 minutes he spewed basic rhetoric and rallied the troops. Unfortunately, this portion was lackluster and forgettable.</p>

<p>However, the mood suddenly changed and McCain told about his time as a prisoner of war in Hanoi during &ldquo;Vee-eht-naaaam.&rdquo; I knew he was a POW, but I did not know the details. His story was moving and delivered with great passion. He capitalized on the moment nicely and wrapped up the speech with a full head of steam.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll give it up to gramps; he did a good job and proved he is not a robot. He is old and pretty poor at reading off the teleprompter, but overall he came across mentally fit. As I&rsquo;ve said before, I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s got too many years left, but his 96 year old mother helps set a precedent for old-age in his family.</p>

<p>So what about the issues?</p>

<p>McCain talks about saving people money, but his tax plan <a title="Obama saves me more $$$" href="http://www.bargaineering.com/articles/obama-vs-mccain-tax-plans-obama-saves-you-more.html" target="_blank">benefits only the rich</a> (when compared to Obama&rsquo;s plan). Personally, I want less government and lower taxes. Obama&rsquo;s tax plan seems to do that better than the old Straight Talk Express.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of talk about how we cannot tell the candidates opinions because they never voted. Well, Christine said <a title="Christine's take on presidential candidates" href="http://drsjulien.blogspot.com/2008/09/lies-and-misleadings.html" target="_blank">this</a> better than I can, so I&rsquo;m going to share: &ldquo;Obama has missed 45.5% of the votes (a lot, to be sure). McCain has missed 63.8%. That&rsquo;s more missed votes than Tim Johnson, who suffered a brain hemorrhage in December. (<a href="http://projects.washingtonpost.com/congress/110/senate/vote-missers/">Numbers</a> from the Washington Post.)&rdquo;</p>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/are-banks-in-trouble/">Are banks in trouble?</a></h1>
      <p>I recently read a sensational piece on ABC News about potential <a title="ABC News: the sky is falling!" href="http://abcnews.go.com/Business/story?id=5660122&amp;page=1" target="_blank">bank failures</a>.It&rsquo;s a relatively long but interesting read.</p>

<p>The story notes that 10-25 regional banks are &ldquo;treading water right now&rdquo; and states that profits of FDIC-insured banks are down a whopping 86%. Our current situation is likened to the Great Depression and we are told that 15 banks could easily fail before year end. Another <a title="wikipedia for Chicken Little" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sky_Is_Falling_(fable)" target="_blank">Chicken Little</a> tidbit: there&rsquo;s not enough insurance to cover all the money in banks right now, so anyone with more than $100k in the bank may be in trouble.</p>

<p>I can appreciate the information presented in the article, but it&rsquo;s rather irresponsible. The story riles people up and offers no advice on how to weather the storm nor tips on what we can do to prevent the stated disasters.</p>

<p>As I read articles like this I have to remember that I don&rsquo;t understand the intricate financial system&mdash;I&rsquo;m an engineer. Journalists don&rsquo;t understand it, nor do lawyers or politicians. In the end, we should trust the economists who are equally vested in the system. No one wins when banks fail. The sky is not falling, but if it is, your 100k+ in the bank won&rsquo;t matter anyway :)</p>

      <p>As McCain chooses his running mate, a hurricane churns in the gulf all but overshadowing his choice of first-term Alaskan governess Palin. Now, with Gustav clear of the coast, the media turns their attention to the RNC and Palin.</p>

<p>Honestly, I was not going to say anything about the choice until I read <a title="thesuperficial.com" href="http://www.thesuperficial.com" target="_blank">TheSuperficial.com</a>&rsquo;s coverage (<a title="thesuperficial.com coverage of Bristol Palin's pregnancy" href="http://thesuperficial.com/2008/09/sarah_palins_17yearold_daughte.php" target="_blank">here</a>). Whenever a celebrity gossip blog covers the story, you have to take notice! I can&rsquo;t help but feel I&rsquo;m reading about Jamie Lynn Spears, not the vice president&rsquo;s daughter! From the article:</p>

<ul>
<li>&ldquo;The McCain campaign revealed the news to rebut rampant rumors that Governor Palin&rsquo;s infant son is actually her grandson and she faked her pregnancy to protect her daughter Bristol. You seriously just read all that, and I&rsquo;m now 90% positive John McCain&rsquo;s research involved picking this woman&rsquo;s name out of of a hat.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>


<p>Truly a seemingly random pick. On the positive side, she is relatively young which offsets McCain&rsquo;s age. She is a minority. Everything Obama or Hillary could say, the McCain camp can too (although I don&rsquo;t think that VP is nearly as important as President). With the playing field more level, we&rsquo;re left with the last positive aspect: beauty. I fear Americans are going to vote based on external traits rather than issues. As a beautiful person myself, I can tell you how Americans are smitten by good-looking people. Why vote based on issues? Let&rsquo;s make this a beauty pageant!</p>

<p>As I said <a title="SethHolloway.com Election 2008" href="http://sethholloway.com/blog/?p=73" target="_blank">previously</a>, I think McCain is nearing the end of his life and needs a strong vice president who could take over. Unfortunately, she&rsquo;s &ldquo;just your average hockey mom in Alaska&rdquo;. I do not care for politicians, but they&rsquo;re good at what they do. As you ascend the political ladder, you should be more politically savvy and capable of making things happen. Palin has skipped too many steps in the political ladder and simply does not have the network nor the know-how to get things done at the presidential level. McCain&rsquo;s age and inability to lead make the choice even worse&mdash;he cannot cover for her&mdash;and if McCain expired, we would be left with an Alaskan hockey mom.</p>

<p>Also, I find it disturbing that Palin has children named Track, Trig, Piper, Willow, and Bristol (<a title="cnn coverage" href="http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/09/01/palin.evangelicals/index.html" target="_blank">who is 17, unwed, and pregnant</a>). I have an uncommon name, but those are over the top. I have to question the judgement of any parent that names their kid Trig. Does an odd name give a child strength? Does she like getting her children beaten up? Does Trig have some meaning, perhaps where/how he was conceived?</p>

<p>If you want to read it from someone with more credibility than me, check what Democratic strategist Begala said <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/08/29/begala.palin/index.html" target="_blank">here</a>. Intelligent, direct, funny.</p>

<p>Sarah Palin: no thanks.</p>

<p>And since I&rsquo;m an idealist youngster, I&rsquo;ll promote the multi-party system. Check out independent candidate <a title="Bob Barr official site" href="http://www.bobbarr2008.com/home/skip/?s=0618" target="_blank">Bob Barr</a>!</p>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/weekend-o-movies/">Weekend o&#8217; movies</a></h1>
      <p>This weekend we saw <a title="Tropic Thunder IMDB" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0942385/" target="_blank">Tropic Thunder</a>, <a title="Forgetting Sarah Marshall IMDB" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0800039/" target="_blank">Forgetting Sarah Marshall</a>, and <a title="Talladega Nights on IMDB" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0415306/" target="_blank">Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby</a>. All three were worth watching and hilarious! Incidentally, I ranked them in order of descending hilarity above. And I&rsquo;m justified because the <a title="Internet Movie Database" href="http://www.imdb.com" target="_blank">IMDB</a> voters seem to agree!</p>

<p>Recently I had been thinking that we did not have enough comedies. It turns out I just hadn&rsquo;t seen them! These movies represent a general cross section of the comic superstars of the past 10 years. We&rsquo;re missing a few big names like Adam Sandler, Vince Vaughn, Steve Carell, and the South Park guys; however, we get Ben Stiller, Will Ferrell, Jack Black, the Judd Apatow crew (Paul Rudd, Jason Segel, Bill Hader, Jonah Hill, etc) and a few newcomers. This year&rsquo;s MTV Movie Awards host, Russell Brand, was funny (not laugh out loud, but pleasant smile) in Forgetting Sarah Marshall. Also, after Pineapple Express (which was also hilarious, although a little long) I&rsquo;m a big fan of Danny McBride&mdash;&ldquo;thug life!&rdquo; Danny was funny in Tropic Thunder. Although I don&rsquo;t think of him as a comediam per se, Robert Downey Jr. was a riot.</p>

<p>And now the baby Jesus and I are off to drink some Booty Sweat energy drink while watching the musical Dracula. (That&rsquo;s right, all three movies alluded to in one genius sequence of words).</p>

<p>Happy Labor Day!</p>

      <p>The powers that be at UT have unanimously decided that <a title="Daily Texan coverage" href="http://media.www.dailytexanonline.com/media/storage/paper410/news/2008/08/29/TopStories/Council.Powers.Shouldnt.Sign.DrinkingAge.Initiative-3409091.shtml" target="_blank">the Amethyst Initiative is not something UT should take part in</a>. The <a title="Amethyst Initiative official page" href="http://www.amethystinitiative.org/" target="_blank">Amethyst Initiative</a> is calling for new debates about the drinking age because &ldquo;21 is not working&rdquo; for the legal drinking age.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure why UT is so against the idea. The Amethyst Initiative was started by big-wigs at schools all over the U.S.A and already has a large number of people behind it. Considering UT is consistently ranked highly amongst <a title="Wikipedia Party Schools" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_school" target="_blank">party schools</a> (<a title="USA Today coverage" href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2006-08-21-party-school-list_x.htm" target="_blank">1st</a>, <a title="Daily Texan coverage" href="http://media.www.dailytexanonline.com/media/storage/paper410/news/2006/08/25/TopStories/Ut.Jumps.14.Places.In.Party.School.Ranking-2239876.shtml" target="_blank">14th</a>, and <a title="Daily Texan coverage" href="http://media.www.dailytexanonline.com/media/storage/paper410/news/2008/07/31/University/News-Briefly.ut.The.No.8.Party.School.In.The.U.s.According.To.College.Guide-3396157.shtml" target="_blank">8th</a>), I think any method to dampen the damage done by alcohol on campus would be wise.</p>

<p>In general, I think the more we repress a behavior, the worse the consequence whenever it surfaces. Young people are drinking. Most do it in private because they have to. If a high schooler drinks, it is not the end of the world. The problem arises whenever they drive home and attempt to deny their activity. At 18 you&rsquo;re old enough to buy tobacco, go to war, and be tried as an adult, but you can&rsquo;t drink. Prohibition failed, but this dangling archaic law persists. I&rsquo;m all for rules to keep the peace and maintain public safety, but drinking itself is not the issue. It&rsquo;s time we opened the debate and looked for what was best for our nation&rsquo;s future.</p>

<p>And I&rsquo;m not just complaining; here are a few ideas how we could achieve the spirit of the law more effectively:</p>

<ul>
<li>create an alcohol awareness course for people who want to drink before 21 (like driver&rsquo;s education)</li>
<li>allow military personnel to buy alcohol</li>
<li>allow college students to buy alcohol</li>
<li>increase public transportation</li>
<li>create more drunk-rides</li>
<li>put breathalyzers on all vehicles</li>
<li>increase penalties for drunken conduct</li>
<li>&hellip;</li>
</ul>
