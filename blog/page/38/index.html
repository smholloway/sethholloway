      <p>Andrea and I love language and culture, although she actually has the degrees to back it up. We love to travel and see how other people live. I ask people about their native tongues; by doing so I&rsquo;ve learned how to say &ldquo;hello&rdquo; in about 15 languages. In the future I&rsquo;d like to beef up my vocabulary more. To do so, I&rsquo;ve found a couple sites with free language education: <a title="BBC Languages" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/languages/" target="_blank">BBC Languages</a> and <a title="MIT Open Courses on Language" href="http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/web/courses/courses/index.htm#ForeignLanguagesandLiteratures" target="_blank">MIT Open Courses</a>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I have not made time to learn a new language yet, but I&rsquo;d love to hear how other people feel about the sites :)</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re struggling with English and you live in the Austin area, you should talk to <a title="Andrea Mire Linkedin" href="http://www.linkedin.com/profile?viewProfile=&amp;key=29993716" target="_blank">Andrea Holloway</a> about accent modification! She has helped several people to improve their pronounciation and is currently working with <a title="Alison McGregor PhD Linkedin" href="http://www.linkedin.com/profile?viewProfile=&amp;key=7298067" target="_blank">Alison McGregor PhD</a>, an <a title="UT ESL Faculty" href="http://www.utexas.edu/student/esl/faculty/" target="_blank">expert </a>on accent modification.</p>

      <p>Now that the four most important politicians have given their speeches and the debates have died down, we will get a flood of differing opinions on the upcoming election. First, I was surprised that a celeb gossip site would write about the Veep. Then, I was surprised when a <a title="About Penelope Trunk" href="http://penelopetrunk.com/aboutme.html" target="_blank">middle-aged single mother CEO</a> of a <a title="brazencareerist.com" href="http://www.brazencareerist.com/" target="_self">career advice website</a> wrote about the VP. Penelope Trunk says that <a title="Palin should be a mother first" href="http://blog.penelopetrunk.com/2008/09/04/palins-children-should-take-priority-over-being-vice-president/" target="_blank">Palin is irresponsible and bound for failure</a> based on her family life. The next day Trunk expresses her desire to <a title="How will Palin fare?" href="http://blog.penelopetrunk.com/2008/09/05/i-hope-i-get-to-travel-on-sarah-palins-plane/" target="_blank">see Palin balance the rigors</a> of fame, extreme travel, and motherhood.</p>

<p>In general, it seems that a lot of people are saying Palin is irresponsible. I found a nice story on <a title="Alaskan Local News Coverage" href="http://www.ktuu.com/global/story.asp?s=8194634" target="_blank">Palin&rsquo;s irresponsibility</a>, it turns out she flew to Texas while extremely pregnant. While waiting to give a speech, her water broke. How did she handle it? She gave the speech then got on a 10 hour flight back to Alaska, then went to the hospital and delivered the baby. It&rsquo;s bad enough that she put her baby through hell, but it&rsquo;s worse because she already knew the child had special needs (read, <a title="wikipedia down syndrome" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Down_syndrome" target="_blank">Down Syndrome</a>). I&rsquo;m glad she can get things done, but that&rsquo;s completey irresponsible.</p>

<p>It feels like a lot of people are against the lipsticked-bulldog, so I am interested to see how the debates unfold and where the political coverage goes.</p>

      <p>Let&rsquo;s all have a moment of silence for innovation in America. Bills such as the one just <a title="Techdirt coverage" href="http://techdirt.com/articles/20080911/1804242241.shtml" target="_blank">approved by the Senate</a> are quickly stifling America&rsquo;s ability to compete in a global economy. We&rsquo;re worried about all the wrong issues! While America clings to power brokers of yesteryear, the rest of the world is evolving at a breakneck speed, generating new ideas and embracing new technologies. Very frustrating!</p>

<p>This comes on the heels of news about <a title="Techdirt coverage" href="http://techdirt.com/articles/20080911/0202322232.shtml" target="_blank">84 students having their GMAT scores revoked</a> because the offending students wrote what they remember from the GMAT on a web forum, and <a title="Techdirt coverage" href="http://techdirt.com/articles/20080911/0352222239.shtml" target="_blank">more Draconian crap from Disney</a>.</p>

<p>The former story feels incredibly petty on the part of Graduate Management Admission Council (creators of the GMAT)&mdash;a pure power struggle. There is a whole industry built around providing a realistic testing experience before you take the test. Whenever I registered for the GRE I was mailed the PowerPrep software for free. PowerPrep is two full GRE tests that you can take to prepare for the real deal. That&rsquo;s in addition to the test book I had. The test book I bought bragged about being realistic. How are these practice tests and test preparation books created if not by recalling information about the test after taking it? Count this as a loss for the good guys.</p>

<p>As for Disney&rsquo;s proposal that filesharers should be banned from the Internet&hellip; wow. Following this scheme you would ban 80% of users within the first month. The other 20% would catch up soon thereafter. There are so many problems with the idea! For example, visit any web forum and you will find &ldquo;illegal&rdquo; content from images and videos to user guides and DRM circumvention methods. And that&rsquo;s just a help forum. God forbid you find one of the many sites that allow for anonymous posting. Say we do ban people, then what? Once you&rsquo;re &ldquo;banned&rdquo; how would we prevent the numerous unsecured ways to get online? No country successfully defends its own borders; the Internet only amplifies the number of issues.</p>

<p>The Internet is no longer a privelege, it&rsquo;s a right. We rely on the Internet for help, fun, and education both personally and professionally. We expect ubiquitous access, at worst we have to pay&mdash;think airplanes offering Wi-Fi. I shed a year for the future given our current course. Don&rsquo;t stand in the way of progress. We need educated people to discuss the Internet and how best to satisfy the stakeholder.</p>

      <p>Last night I caught about 5 minutes of the <a title="Spike online" href="http://www.spike.com/network/spike" target="_blank">Spike</a> show <a title="Manswers " href="http://www.spike.com/group/manswers" target="_blank">Manswers</a> (potentially NSFW) and they asked, &ldquo;How long could you survive in space without a spacesuit?&rdquo; The correct answer was 1.5 minutes. According to Manswers, no human has ever been subjected to space without a suit; however, astronauts did throw dogs into the void of space &ldquo;for science.&rdquo; Surprisingly, pooches do not fare any better than we humans do.</p>

<p>What Manswers didn&rsquo;t mention was <a title="wikipedia water bears" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tardigrada" target="_blank">water bears</a>, or Tardigrade. Tardigrade are eight-legged animals about <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">1cm</span> 2mm long that live in water. These strange little creatures are all over the place, but I don&rsquo;t remember learning about them in school. I wish I had because Tardigrade are freaks of nature! They make Biology sound interesting ;)</p>

<p>From the wikipedia article: &ldquo;Tardigrades are able to survive in extreme environments that would kill almost any other animal. Some can survive temperatures close to absolute zero<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tardigrada#cite_note-3">[4]</a></sup>, temperatures as high as 151°C (303°F), 1,000 times more radiation than any other animal<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tardigrada#cite_note-4">[5]</a></sup>, nearly a decade without water, and even the vacuum of space.<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tardigrada#cite_note-5">[6]</a></sup>&rdquo;</p>

<p>I actually found out about water bears through an interesting article on Wired, <a title="Wired.com article on water cows" href="http://blog.wired.com/wiredscience/2008/09/invertebrate-as.html" target="_blank">Invertebrate Astronauts Make Space History</a>, about water bears surviving in space without any protection. Basically, scientists put Tardigrade in a box, strapped it to a satellite, and let the little guys orbit the Earth. The water bears survived based on amazing biological processes like 1) slowing their metabolism down to 1/10,000 the normal rate and 2) repairing cellular damage caused by cosmic radiation. One day, scientists may even know how water bears do it; until then, bask in the glory of Tardigrade:

<p>(Source: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Waterbear.jpg">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Waterbear.jpg</a>)</p>

<p>If you look closely you&rsquo;ll see the little guy is smiling. We can only assume he&rsquo;s saying, &ldquo;I am biologically superior to billions of other species!</p>

      <p>This is a quick post simply to get the word out because I&rsquo;m not seeing much about this story today despite it&rsquo;s potentially large ramifications. <a title="lane holloway is awesome" href="http://www.laneholloway.com" target="_blank">Lane</a> passed along the news that <a title="MSN coverage of &quot;The Death of OPEC&quot;" href="http://blogs.moneycentral.msn.com/topstocks/archive/2008/09/11/the-death-of-opec.aspx" target="_blank">Saudi Arabia has walked out on talks with OPEC</a>. Apparently, they are tired of Hugo Chavez and Iran. The Saudis are pledging to fill the world&rsquo;s oil needs. While good for the consumer right now, I&rsquo;m not sure how this will effect the world. The MSN story may be making a mountain out of a molehill&mdash;I&rsquo;m interested to hear more as the situation unfolds.</p>

      <p>On my bike ride in ths morning I was thinking about weather <a title="Seth Holloway Aug 09, 2008 Post" href="http://sethholloway.com/blog/?p=102" target="_blank">again</a>. While getting ready this morning I had the TV on. I would do a task then check the TV&mdash;no weather&mdash;so I&rsquo;d do another task and check the TV&mdash;still no weather. All the while the news icon is taunting me in the bottom left corner of the screen. The simple graphic states the affiliate name and the temperature in a given area. Fox, NBC, CBS, ABC, and News 8 Austin were all roughtly the same icon. Why not put an umbrella sign if it is likely to rain?</p>

<p>Seriously. Augment the current graphic with an unobtrusive umbrella icon. Simple. Clean. Efficient. Helpful. Personally, I would still have the channel on for a few minutes each morning, so the channels do not need to worry about ratings. If anything, I&rsquo;d watch the channel more often because they would reliably give me the information I wanted. except I would leave the house more informed and happier. I can dream!</p>

      <p>I started riding my bike to campus this summer (started around May 2008). In the few months since then I have learned to pay more attention to the weather and my departure time. Beyond clear skies and moderate temperatures I treasure fewer cars on the road, adequate ambient light, and green traffic signals!</p>

<p>I saved the best for last: I want low humidity! This morning Austin is around 90% humidity and the ride into campus was miserable&mdash;despite moderate temperatures. With high humidity the body cannot cool off properly and it feels like you&rsquo;re pedaling through a swimming pool.</p>

<p>And since I&rsquo;m talking about weather, I&rsquo;d like to share a couple cool sites I found recently. <a title="umbrellatoday.com" href="http://umbrellatoday.com/" target="_blank">Umbrellatoday</a> simplifies the weather interface and simply tells you whether or not you need an umbrella. Contrast that to the <a title="weather.com" href="http://www.weather.com/outlook/health/allergies/local/78757?lswe=78757&amp;lwsa=Weather36HourAllergiesCommand&amp;from=searchbox" target="_blank">weather.com page</a>; I see graphics, radar images, a lot of text, multiple different colors, and several days worth of forecasts. I just need to know if it will rain today so I can make an informed choice about riding my bike versus taking the bus, and Umbrellatoday comes to my rescue.</p>

<p>Another site that keeps it simple is <a title="Stormpulse.com" href="http://www.stormpulse.com/" target="_blank">Stormpulse</a>, an excellent source for tropical storm information. Contrast the Stormpulse interface to the <a title="Stormtracker on NOAA" href="http://www.stormtracker.noaa.gov/" target="_blank">official government storm tracking website</a>. There are times when I want to find out about weather events without wading through all the other stuff (think <a title="cnn.com" href="http://wwww.cnn.com/" target="_blank">cnn.com</a>); Stormpulse is perfect in those situations.</p>

<p>Note: both sites are still new to me (and the world in general, I think). We&rsquo;ll see how accurate and reliable they are. As always, your mileage may vary.</p>

The 42 questions are pretty obvious, which is sad because according to their calculator, I waste $556 a month! To be honest, there were a few items that I did not think much of, but I suppose that is the nature of savings: every bit counts.</p>

<p>I encourage you to take the quick quiz and see if there&rsquo;s anything wasteful that you&rsquo;re not aware of.</p>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/the-students-in-software-engineering/">The Students in Software Engineering</a></h1>
      <p>Friday (September 5) marked the kickoff of the Students in Software Engineering (SSE), an organization that I started with my labmate and friend, Justin Enderle. The idea for the organization started in spring 2008 during Software Engineering faculty candidate interviews. As a newer student Justin did not know his peers sitting around the table. In a relatively small department like Software Engineering, the students should know one another.</p>

<p>We started sowing the seeds this summer. Our goal was simple: unite the students in Software Engineering. However, formalizing that goal and deciding how to proceed has involved a great deal of work. We had numerous meetings with EDGE assistant director, Rick Scott, as well as our adviser, Dr. Christine Julien, as we hammered out the kinks. I&rsquo;m extremely proud of our progress!</p>

<p>After a great deal of effort and a lot of lessons learned, we were able to launch successfully! Our first meeting featured a mix of sodas and water, lots of Domino&rsquo;s pizza, and a talk by the always awesome Dr. Christine Julien. We had 31 students and 3 faculty from the Software Engineering track in attendance. Our favorite oracle, Rick Scott, also showed up&mdash;woot!</p>

<p>In addition to a strong turnout and positive feedback, the organization gained two excellent new officers: Dave DeAngelis and Robert Grant. With the extra help the organization is stronger than ever, and Justin and I should be able to continue doing our jobs&mdash;researching :)</p>

<p>Overall, I am very pleased with our first meeting and our general progress. I&rsquo;ve learned a lot about starting an organization, marketing your brand, managing people, and being a constructive, productive audience member. I look forward to future lessons-learned and organizational successes!</p>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/mccain-says-i-am-not-a-robot/">McCain says, &#8220;I am not a robot&#8221;</a></h1>
      <p>McCain gave his acceptance speech at Thursday night&rsquo;s RNC. The first thing I noticed was how stiff he was: his shoulders crooked and hunched, his arms hung languidly at his sides. He walked out and started his speech. For over 30 minutes he spewed basic rhetoric and rallied the troops. Unfortunately, this portion was lackluster and forgettable.</p>

<p>However, the mood suddenly changed and McCain told about his time as a prisoner of war in Hanoi during &ldquo;Vee-eht-naaaam.&rdquo; I knew he was a POW, but I did not know the details. His story was moving and delivered with great passion. He capitalized on the moment nicely and wrapped up the speech with a full head of steam.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll give it up to gramps; he did a good job and proved he is not a robot. He is old and pretty poor at reading off the teleprompter, but overall he came across mentally fit. As I&rsquo;ve said before, I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s got too many years left, but his 96 year old mother helps set a precedent for old-age in his family.</p>

<p>So what about the issues?</p>

<p>McCain talks about saving people money, but his tax plan <a title="Obama saves me more $$$" href="http://www.bargaineering.com/articles/obama-vs-mccain-tax-plans-obama-saves-you-more.html" target="_blank">benefits only the rich</a> (when compared to Obama&rsquo;s plan). Personally, I want less government and lower taxes. Obama&rsquo;s tax plan seems to do that better than the old Straight Talk Express.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of talk about how we cannot tell the candidates opinions because they never voted. Well, Christine said <a title="Christine's take on presidential candidates" href="http://drsjulien.blogspot.com/2008/09/lies-and-misleadings.html" target="_blank">this</a> better than I can, so I&rsquo;m going to share: &ldquo;Obama has missed 45.5% of the votes (a lot, to be sure). McCain has missed 63.8%. That&rsquo;s more missed votes than Tim Johnson, who suffered a brain hemorrhage in December. (<a href="http://projects.washingtonpost.com/congress/110/senate/vote-missers/">Numbers</a> from the Washington Post.)&rdquo;</p>
