      <p>It was a busy month for reading. Lots of good stuff!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ARSJNW6/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00ARSJNW6&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=theven01-20&amp;linkId=KQP7U6OB4WMDL2XX">Dracula Chronicles: Son of the Dragon by Victor
Foia</a>. An interesting retelling of the life of Dracula. This book, the first of three, tracks Dracula in his teenage years as he makes his first kill. The book was really good, but I was looking for more fantasy.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00APA1NK6/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00APA1NK6&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=theven01-20&amp;linkId=WMOFDYAVZR4UFKHT">Spellbound by Larry
Correia</a>. Correia has the fantasy adventure
story down. Very entertaining. I look forward to finishing the series
(Grimnoir Chronicles) soon.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CD360ZQ/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00CD360ZQ&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=theven01-20&amp;linkId=KKUCVAWJ3O2JOMPV">Alas, Babylon by Pat
Frank</a>. A slice of life in the alternate reality
where the cold war ended with nuclear war. I could see this
book as the precursor to The Road by McCarthy. I liked it.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00D4CBA50/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00D4CBA50&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=theven01-20&amp;linkId=KN3MMS2ERWTKFAU7">At the Mountains of Madness by H.P.
Lovecraft</a>. Beware the elder
things buried in Antarctica.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00COOFBA4/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00COOFBA4&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=theven01-20&amp;linkId=U74HXIB7CQ3OEZNU">How to Fail at Almost Everything and Still Win Big by Scott
Adams</a>. Scott Adams is the creator of the workplace comic, <a href="http://www.dilbert.com/">Dilbert</a>. In this book Adams lays out his lessons on life. Some of the high points: eat well, exercise, get into a routine, optimize your personal energy, learn as many different skills as you can (because success is likely to come from some combination of your skills), and passion is just a fancy way for successful people to say they got lucky. I really liked the book; I thought it was funny and informative, and I loved the humility with which the story was told. Where many books and life stories rewrite history and show how one success begot another, Adams instead talks about how his failures lead to success. The anecdotes were modest and on-point, which I found refreshing and brave.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009U9S6FI/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B009U9S6FI&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=theven01-20&amp;linkId=3S6RUEUONCG3UEAU">Man&rsquo;s Search for Meaning by Viktor
Frankl</a>. A Jewish psychiatrist&rsquo;s
Holocaust story helps explain his world view and motivate his
psychotherapy approach,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logotherapy">Logotherapy</a>. I appreciated
that the book was honest without dwelling too much on the atrocities:
rather than recounting every terrible thing that happened, Frankl picks
a few key events that provide a broad understanding. Remarkably, Frankl
does something constructive with his grief. In the book he mentions that
Logotherapy might ask a patient why that patient does not commit
suicide because the answer reveals your meaning, which you can then work
with to heal. One of the most disturbing parts of the book for me was
Frankl&rsquo;s account of returning home to a nation that ignored the
concentration camps or downplayed their significance; he writes that for
many survivors life after the camp was harder than life in the camp.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009AYWPCI/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B009AYWPCI&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=theven01-20&amp;linkId=XSJDV3OEBODUC5IH">Futures and Frosting by Tara
Sivec</a>. Futures and Frosting tells the
story of how a single-mother is reunited with the father of her child;
after a lot of confusion, the couple gets married and has another kid,
then lives happily ever after. Without the humor, it would read like
an angsty young adult love story.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596518382/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0596518382&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=theven01-20&amp;linkId=HYDQVVVHWRDD54ZB">Apprenticeship Patterns by Dave Hoover and Ade
Oshineye</a>.
This was probably the most accessible technical book I&rsquo;ve read. The
application of pattern language to a career is really clever and worked
well. As with software patterns, it&rsquo;s nice to see the path.</p>

Sinek</a>. I loved this book because it
resonated with my hopes for the future of business. Sinek also brought
in some of my favorite psychological ideas in a way that I found
inspiring&mdash;I&rsquo;ve read a lot of the same research and come across the same
ideas, but I had not synthesized the data into a coherent worldview.
I&rsquo;d boil it down to the following: short-term profit maximization is
proving unsustainable even harmful for society; instead, you should treat
employees as people to enjoy sustained growth.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FC10MU/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000FC10MU&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=theven01-20&amp;linkId=GQKSUWEFX3EOXXTL">American Gods by Neil
Gaiman</a>. Based on numerous positive reviews I
was really excited to read this book; unfortunately, I didn&rsquo;t care much
for it. In the preface Gaiman says that the book is long and meandering,
and he hit the nail on the head. I thought the main plot was pretty
interesting, but the tangents did not add anything for me. At times it
felt like I was reading a book for English class because I just didn&rsquo;t
understand the message.</p>

<p><a href="ttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00FCQQCX6/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00FCQQCX6&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=theven01-20&amp;linkId=ZEIIG5IJ2ZYDFWFL">The Emperor&rsquo;s Blades by Brian
Stavely</a>. I liked the book, but I&rsquo;m not
sure I&rsquo;m ready for another series just yet.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Poor-Economics-rethinking-poverty-ways-ebook/dp/B007CI81IQ/ref=sr_1_1?tag=theven01-20">Poor Economics by Abhijit Banerjee and Esther Duflo</a>. An accessible summary
of research about poor people worldwide. I loved the realistic approach
to helping people. Some of my favorite tidbits were that people donated
significantly more money when the message focused on a single,
identifiable person and that when given money, poor people tend to buy
more interesting food rather than more of the same (in the studies
people still ate around 1200 calories but they would incorporated more
meat and indulgences like tea rather than eating another 500 calories of
rice).</p>

McCarthy</a>. A short but powerful book&mdash;I see why it was made into a movie. Turns out the apocalypse is no fun.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005IHWBSY/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B005IHWBSY&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=theven01-20&amp;linkId=27ID6XF3TZLBRUHR">God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater by Kurt
Vonnegut</a>. I&rsquo;m ashamed to admit that this is my first Vonnegut book. I&rsquo;ve broken the seal, and I enjoyed it. The book has a socialist bent, so I&rsquo;d love to hear what a strong capitalist thought of this book.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006LSZECO/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B006LSZECO&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=theven01-20&amp;linkId=CTUBO5ECTNQJQN3S">Gone Girl by Gillian
Flynn</a>. I finished this before seeing the movie. My overall reaction is, &ldquo;wow.&rdquo; I didn&rsquo;t like it, then liked it, then loved it, then didn&rsquo;t like it. It was original and well written, for what that&rsquo;s worth.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0787960756/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0787960756&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=theven01-20">The Five Dysfunctions of a Team by Patrick
Lencioni</a>.
I&rsquo;ve now read a few Lencioni books, and I really enjoy them. I find his novel
approach to business lessons is very accessible. This book says you need
to first establish trust so that people will speak freely. Without
trust, people cannot engage in productive arguments, so people do not
buy in&mdash;they just quit arguing. Once you have trust, an open exchange of
ideas, and commitment to a shared vision, you can start holding people
accountable. Finally, you can focus on results. The five dysfunctions
are presented as a pyramid, which highlights the need to achieve the
previous level before moving up&mdash;I thought that was kind of like
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow's_hierarchy_of_needs">Maslow&rsquo;s Hierarchy of
Needs</a> applied
to business.</p>

      <p>I have a lot of series started now, and I&rsquo;m not sure which one I will continue next.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004KABDMA/ref=as_li_tl?tag=theven01-20">Satanic Verses by Salman Rushdie</a>. This book is really well written and historically important&mdash;the amount of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Satanic_Verses#Controversy">controversy</a> around this novel is unreal! Unfortunately, I did not care for the book. I made it through about 2/3 before I decided I&rsquo;d much rather be reading something else. Fear not! I&rsquo;ve read the summary so I know how it ends ;&ndash;)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005GLS7SU/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B005GLS7SU&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=theven01-20&amp;linkId=DWGB7CV6GVSL3XT7">The Legend of Drizzt: The Collected Stories by R.A.
Salvatore</a>. I always like Drizzt stories. This is a sequence of vignettes that is less interesting than a complete story. It fills some gaps, but also spoils entire books; I&rsquo;d say you should read it after you&rsquo;ve read all the other books.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004J4WN0I/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B004J4WN0I&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=theven01-20&amp;linkId=ALNRNFQYLDFTUFJ3">Hounded: The Iron Druid Chronicles, Book One by Kevin
Hearne</a>. I found this very entertaining; I found it to be an interesting, fresh take on Druidic magic.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WH7PLS/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000WH7PLS&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=theven01-20&amp;linkId=FUZ7WVMF7CLGK3WU">Storm Front (The Dresden Files, Book 1) by Jim
Butcher</a>. A couple years ago I tore through the Dresden Files series on Netflix, so this reading was a long time coming. Unsurprisingly, the book is better than the show, but I&rsquo;d recommend both.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005K0AYH4/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B005K0AYH4&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=theven01-20&amp;linkId=4AQUFSLWMQYJDDLC">Crucial Conversations by Kerry
Patterson</a>. This is a very useful book that offers &ldquo;tools for talking when the stakes are high.&rdquo; Some of the biggest takeaways for me: focus on what <em>you</em> can do better and &lsquo;start with heart,&rsquo; that is, be honest and heartfelt without blaming. I plan to re-read again sometime.</p>

      <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060899220/ref=as_li_tl?tag=theven01-20">Kitchen Confidential by Anthony
Bourdain</a>. I loved the insight into the restaurant industry. Bourdain is a really good writer, which complements his crass, honest style. If you want to know what the people in the kitchen are up to, read this book.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/B0010U3Z3S/ref=as_li_tl?tag=theven01-20">The Forbidden Tower by Marion Zimmer
Bradley</a>. Apparently this is the worst of the Darkover series, so it&rsquo;s unfortunate that it is where I started. I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;ll continue the series.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0345335082/ref=as_li_tl?tag=theven01-20">Dragonquest (Dragonriders of Pern #2) by Anne
McCaffrey</a>. Meh. I liked this book when I read it, but I don&rsquo;t have overwhelmingly positive memories now.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0140286802/ref=as_li_tl?tag=theven01-20">Collected Fictions by Jorge Luis
Borges</a>. Sol Stein raved about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jorge_Luis_Borges">Borges</a>, and Borges sounded like an author worth reading. Short stories are really different for me because I normally read technical books or novels. That said, I found Borges&#8217; stories to be interesting.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1591843200/ref=as_li_tl?tag=theven01-20">Street Smarts: An All-Purpose Tool Kit for Entrepreneurs by Norm
Brodsky and Bo
Burlingham</a>. Following Lean Startup I was feeling entrepreneurial and this book looked good. It was good. Lots of good lessons. I&rsquo;ve noticed that a lot of business books rely on personal anecdotes from a single success; it&rsquo;s not bad, and I understand that making millions of dollars over many years would certainly teach you a lot, but it is odd when every lesson takes you back to a story from a single company.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1439133913/ref=as_li_tl?tag=theven01-20">Monster Hunter Vendetta by Larry
Correia</a>. I&rsquo;ve now started two
Correia series (Grimnoir and Monster Hunters), and I really like both.
He writes really fun, fast-paced books that remind me of action movies.
I&rsquo;ll be reading more of these as soon as I clear out my queue.</p>

      <p>July was my most prolific month in a while because I resolved to finish
three books that had been half-read for quite a while.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321721330/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0321721330&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=theven01-20&amp;linkId=ZK7VTYCXU5KS6GXZ">Practical Object Oriented Design in Ruby by Sandi
Metz</a>. This book is
insanely highly rated online and came highly recommended by a friend. I agree with those
positive reviews. While the examples
are in Ruby, I think there&rsquo;s enough generic information that everyone
could learn something from this book. I really like how thorough and
fair the book is in consistently describing advantages and disadvantages.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00HFUJP5Y/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00HFUJP5Y&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=theven01-20&amp;linkId=7HSTVSTRT3QJEQLG">Stein on Writing by Sol
Stein</a>. I&rsquo;ve now read a few books about how
to write well, and this one is my favorite. Classic writing advice is to
&ldquo;show, don&rsquo;t tell&rdquo; but this is the only book with examples at how to
follow through with that advice. I was inspired by numerous before and
after examples.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000FC0SIM/?tag=theven01-20">On Writing by Stephen King</a>.
Stephen King is such a good writer! There are a lot of good lessons in
the book, although I&rsquo;ve read most of them elsewhere. That said, it was good to get King&rsquo;s perspective on
each, including show don&rsquo;t tell, keep dialogue realistic, and edit
relentlessly. Plus, this book led me to Stein on Writing, which had more

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1556346298/?tag=theven01-20">Robin&rsquo;s Laws of Good Game Mastering by Robin Law</a>.
There was a lot of good information here, but I preferred the Sly Flourish guide that I read a few months ago. There&rsquo;s room for both, but Sly Flourish feels like an updated version of Robin&rsquo;s Laws.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00GOZV3TM/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00GOZV3TM&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=theven01-20&amp;linkId=JHUHJIRGD2M57LIE">The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People by Stephen
Covey</a>. A nice
refresher on some things that I needed to relearn. The seven habits are
(1) Be Proactive, (2) Begin with the End in Mind, (3) Put First Things
First, (4) Think Win-Win, (5) Seek First to Understand, Then to be
Understood, (6) Synergize, and (7) Sharpen the Saw. I think 3 and 7
resonated most with the current me. Covey conveys a refreshing message of hope
through his &ldquo;abundance mentality&rdquo; and suggests that you live a life of
integrity. Here&rsquo;s to being more effective!</p>

Dad</a>.
Interesting ideas and well written. I respect that a rich person is
willing to reveal his secrets, like incorporating to avoid paying taxes.
At times it was off-putting as he sounded like a heartless asshole (for example,
saying that more money won&rsquo;t help people so it&rsquo;s okay to pay them low
wages) but it is fascinating to read how a rich person views the
situation.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001NLL6QW/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001NLL6QW&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=theven01-20&amp;linkId=P4WMAT5XSTA46F4F">The Warded Man by Peter
Brett</a>. In a world where
demons attack at night, the world needs a hero&mdash;and they get him. This
was an entertaining fantasy tale. The first book did not feel as deep as Wheel of Time or
A Song of Fire and Ice or Kingkiller Chronicles, although I expect the
characters would grow into their own as the story unfolds.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004J4WNL2/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B004J4WNL2&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=theven01-20&amp;linkId=K4L4KVEC62MJVDZX">Quiet by Susan
Cain</a>. Introverts are taking over the world! Quiet is
a good book that tells you it is okay to not go out every night.</p>

<p><a href="ttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001FA0GJO/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001FA0GJO&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=theven01-20&amp;linkId=LPS4PGZI44X5CDNQ">The Three Big Questions for a Frantic Family by Patrick
Lencioni</a>.
Lencioni is a management consultant and business writer who teaches with
entertaining fables. I gave this book a shot because I previously read and enjoyed <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0743564685/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=theven01-20&amp;linkId=MOAKF2QKN2BT3G4N">The Five Temptations of a
CEO</a>,
where management lessons unfold on a late-night train ride. It was a quick read that was overall
worthwhile (though I would not spend $15 on it). The premise is simple: apply tried-and-true business tactics
to your family and reap the rewards.  Not to spoil it for you, but the
three questions are (1) What makes us unique? (2) What&rsquo;s our top priority
right now? (3) How will we achieve our goals? Pretty easy in theory,
though I suspect that answering these questions and keeping up to date
with the priorities is challenging.</p>

      <p>I’m proud to present <a href="https://swiftgive.com">Swiftgive.com</a>. Swiftgive provides free,
mobile-friendly money transfer. By scanning a QR code you can easily
give some money.</p>

<p>If you’re trying to raise money, just create a fund on the site.  After
creating a fund, you can direct people to your fund’s webpage (which
would look something like <a href="http://swiftgive.com/funds/swiftgive">this</a>) or buy
specially coded marketing products directly from the site. All marketing
products have your fund’s give code on them (basically fancy QR codes).
Give codes are readable by most barcode reading apps.</p>

<p>Here’s an example&mdash;feel free to scan it and give us a few bucks ;&ndash;)</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/evnxxKy.png" alt="donate to swiftgive" /></p>

<p>My friend and <a href="http://www.oilfieldintelligence.com">Oilfield
Intelligence</a> co-founder, Ken, came
up with the idea when he was rushing to the airport late one evening.
He took a bus from the parking lot to the terminal and the bus driver
provided excellent service, helping him with bags and even cracking
jokes the entire drive.  When Ken went to tip the driver, he realized he
didn’t have any small bills (nobody carries cash anymore!).  He had a
cell phone and a debit card, but no cash. So, he did what any
industrious programmer would do: he created a prototype of what tipping
should look like. I joined him to help flesh out the concept and we’re
now ready to pull back the curtain.</p>

<p>We’ve talked to musicians, valets, and friends in various fields, and
the response has been positive. Anyone looking to accept money&mdash;be it
tips or fundraising&mdash;can sign up and use the site for free. You can even
help promote someone else’s fund.</p>

<p>In an alpha launch we helped transfer over $1,000, so we think the idea
is helpful. We definitely hope that it is.</p>

<p>There are other services out there that offer mobile payments, but
Swiftgive approaches the problem a little differently. Swiftgive
believes that mobile tipping and fundraising should be easy and
inexpensive.</p>

<p>Swiftgive makes it easy to get professional quality marketing products
to show off your fund.  Receivers don’t need a smartphone to accept
money&mdash;just an email address and debit card. Also, Swiftgive uses debit
cards only.  Other services generally rely on credit cards&mdash;they use
payment processors and pass the fees onto you. Credit card fees (usually
around 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction) can eat away a substantial amount
of your earnings, especially for small payments. This is the same reason
any self-respecting business owner will grimace when you try to buy a
pack of gum with your Visa.  We’re more interested in getting money to
people than to credit card processing companies.</p>

<p>Go forth and raise some money or tip that bus driver for great
service&mdash;even if you don’t have any cash.</p>

      <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004J4XGN6/?tag=theven01-20">Lean Startup by Eric Ries</a>. I&rsquo;m a little embarrassed that I took this long to read this book. It&rsquo;s an iconic book in the startup world that I had skipped because I watched a few Lean Startup talks and read various blogs about it. A lot of the advice is very common sense; I&rsquo;d boil it down to &ldquo;build something people want.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007ZBNVVW/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B007ZBNVVW&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=theven01-20&amp;linkId=GVZ6UKTYN4WQQV5V" title="">The Developers Guide to Debugging by Thorsten Grötker, Ulrich Holtmann, Holger Keding, and Markus Wloka</a>. I was discussing what makes a good software developer with a friend and he was adamant than the best developers are the best debuggers. I read this book in hopes of filling in the knowledge that I might have learned from a debugging course in school&mdash;if one existed. The book was readable, but it was a bit too C-centric for me to fully appreciate.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00B5HR4A6/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00B5HR4A6&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=theven01-20&amp;linkId=EJTEY3HD2Y2TCALC">Tipping Sacred Cows: Kicking the Bad Work Habits that Masquerade as Virtues by Jake Breeden</a>. The book was what you&rsquo;d expect from a business book with a provocative title. There were some interesting insights; essentially, question your assumptions with respect to balance, collaboration, creativity, excellence, fairness, passion, and preparation.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004G60EHS/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B004G60EHS&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=theven01-20&amp;linkId=7RHQZ7Y2T5QSB4U5">Hyperion by Dan Simmons</a>. This was a <a href="http://sethholloway.com/hugo-award-winners-and-nominees-fantasy/">Hugo Award winner in 1990</a>, but I wasn&rsquo;t a huge fan. The writing is solid and the story is unique. But, you only meet the cast of characters in this book. I kept waiting for something to happen and it never did&mdash;the cliffhanger just wasn&rsquo;t enough for me.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JMKNJ2/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=theven01-20&amp;linkId=L54Q2AKLBLDEJUPF">The Lies of Locke Lamora by Scott Lynch</a>. I read this based on a recommendation, and thoroughly enjoyed it. Locke Lamora is an orphan thief that we meet as a child and follow through young adulthood. I could see the book being made into a great heist movie.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00APAHLMA/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00APAHLMA&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=theven01-20&amp;linkId=DBSWFF52Y6BTDVDE">Hard Magic by Larry Correa</a>. I really liked this book. It&rsquo;s set in a parallel universe circa 1940 where magic is real and several well known figures owe their success to their own inate magic. The characters were interesting and the story moved along nicely.</p>

It&rsquo;s Drizzt&mdash;what&rsquo;s not to like? I previously read books one and two; I mistakenly bought this one thinking it was three (it is actually 7). On the plus side, I can probably skip ahead in the story now that I know what happens after the books I missed!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FC2L1O/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=theven01-20&amp;linkId=4ANBLIVMQ7652A5D">Outlander by Diana
Gabaldon</a>. Andrea loved this series and wanted to know if I would like it too. I did not, but I cannot say why. There was a lot of sex, but plenty of books I like have sex; there was romance that did not resonate with me; there was a lot of history, which I must admit I don&rsquo;t care about. I guess I would rather read about a badass Drow ranger defeating a golem than read about a woman lost in time.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00EN4Q8OQ/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=theven01-20&amp;linkId=YF3QF5TEVNFXRHAM">The Dracula Chronicles: The Lamb of
God by Shane KP Oneill</a>. This was a very quick read that introduces Dracula. The first book published in this series takes place well after this prequel, but I thought it would be good to start at the beginning. It was good, so I plan to continue this series after I finish some other books.</p>

Smith</a>. I&rsquo;ve heard a ton about this book, and I&rsquo;d like to have a better grasp on economics. It started off well; Smith lays the foundation of economics and currency, and it is brilliant, logical stuff. That being said, I ultimately abandoned the book about 1/6th of the way in when the author stated how much tobacco you should expect a negro between sixteen and sixty years to pick. I know that in 1776 statements like that were not in poor taste&mdash;Smith was likely very progressive&mdash;but one too many outdated terms made me question how applicable the book truly is. I include the book in this list because I don&rsquo;t plan to finish it.</p>

      <p>I barely hit my goal of four books a month! I continued on the Kingkiller
Chronicles and finished a couple books from Lois McMaster Bujold, who I learned
about when looking at <a href="http://sethholloway.com/hugo-award-winners-and-nominees-fantasy/">Hugo Fantasy winners</a>.
I also fit in one non-fiction book that had been on my &ldquo;to-read&rdquo; list for a while.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00475AYJQ/?tag=theven01-20">The Wise Man&rsquo;s Fear by Patrick Rothfuss</a>.
I loved this book, and now I&rsquo;m ready for book three. Speaking of waiting
for the conclusion of a story, <a href="http://www.patrickrothfuss.com/content/reviews.asp">George R. R. Martin said</a>,
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s bloody good, this Rothfuss guy.&rdquo; May both Patrick Rothfuss and GRRM finish their series soon!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FC11AQ/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000FC11AQ&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=theven01-20&amp;linkId=OEM63HL3THDLOU4V">The Curse of Chalion by Lois McMaster Bujold</a>.
I liked this book, but it fell short of what I expected from a Hugo Award winner.
The story could have been told with many fewer words, although I don&rsquo;t claim to
know which words needed to be cut. There were some neat concepts; e.g., in this
universe there are five gods who visit mortals. The gods grant blessings and
bestow curses. There are also demons that can jump into human hosts and corrupt
the person from the inside out, while granting some supernatural abilities.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FC138Q/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000FC138Q&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=theven01-20&amp;linkId=SQKW2GDXK57IBB5F">Paladin of Souls by Lois McMaster Bujold</a>.
I had already completed the first book (The Curse of Chalion), so I continued
on to this book. I preferred this one, perhaps because the story was richer for
building on the realm of Chalion, which I had read a whole book about.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0097CWIDY/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0097CWIDY&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=theven01-20&amp;linkId=LVHIEKBKBJFQ2V4L">Boys Adrift by Leonard Sax</a>.
I thought this book made some good points, but I was ultimately unconvinced. In
the introduction, Sax says that on college campuses females outnumber males 2:1;
however, he also says that college is now 58% female and 42% male. 58:42 is not
2:1&mdash;it&rsquo;s 1.38:1. From this point on, I was much more skeptical of the
information. Sax&#8217; <a href="http://www.boysadrift.com/factors.php">five factors</a> are
video games, teaching methods, prescription drugs, endocrine disruptors, and
devaluation of masculinity; of those, each have some merit, but it felt a bit
like listening to an old person railing on young people. You know, &ldquo;back in my
day, men were men!&rdquo; The evidence felt like a collection of anecdotes and a lot
of just-so stories. Some of the ideas came across as shamefully outdated
opinions, which is unfortunate. Why is it so highly rated? I suspect because
there&rsquo;s a huge selection bias&mdash;people who do not believe boys are adrift simply
will not read the book.</p>
