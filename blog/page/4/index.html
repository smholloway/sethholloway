      <h1 class="link"><a href="/analyzing-recruiter-emails/">Analyzing recruiter emails</a></h1>
      <p>I receive a fair amount of cold calls from recruiters. One night I responded to three emails and realized I could not distinguish between the three within seconds after reading them. Why not you ask? It&rsquo;s not because I&rsquo;m a weak reader or blew the people off, it&rsquo;s because the emails are so generic!</p>

<p>Below I provide a simple text analysis of emails I received and provide suggestions on how recruiters could be more effective when working with software developers.</p>

<h3>Quick Data Analysis</h3>


<ul>
<li>Examined 91 emails (trimmed down from hundreds)</li>
<li>21 of the emails contained a confidentiality notice &ndash; <em>gag</em></li>
<li>76 used my name</li>
<li>44 opened with &ldquo;Hi Seth&rdquo;</li>
<li>50 were sent from self-reported recruiters</li>
<li>2 simply had &ldquo;resume&rdquo; in the subject &ndash; I didn&rsquo;t know what to resume, so I couldn&rsquo;t reply (pedantic joke about spelling résumé)</li>
<li>I average email was 16009 bytes total</li>
<li>4 used the term &lsquo;touch base&rsquo; which I expected to see more frequently</li>
<li>referral bonuses of $500-2000 were explicitly mentioned</li>
<li>6 mentioned their funding (VC backed)</li>
<li>1 mentioned incredible salary (over $150k with a $50k signing bonus)</li>
</ul>


<p>Recruiter emails are remarkably formulaic. Most contain the phrase &ldquo;exciting opportunity.&rdquo; Most invite you to forward the opportunity to anyone else you know; this one bugs me every time for two reasons: (1) recruiters are casting a really wide net (in the past, two friends have forwarded me opportunities that the recruiter had already contacted me about) and (2) I feel like I&rsquo;m doing the recruiter&rsquo;s job if I help them place someone (I don&rsquo;t owe the recruiter any favors and I generally have not been impressed by the job or the way it is presented by the recruiter).</p>

<h3>Suggestions</h3>


<p>Software engineers are highly intelligent, analytical, logical, and highly sought after. Proofread your communications! I&rsquo;ve seen misspellings, repeated phrases (coders are familiar with copy/paste errors), weak grammar, and (my pet peeve) incorrectly specified technologies (&ldquo;Jquery&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;jQuery&rdquo; is my favorite).</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t say you have a cutting edge position when you don&rsquo;t. How do you know if you&rsquo;re not cutting edge? If you&rsquo;re using years-old technology in a well-known domain, you&rsquo;re probably not cutting edge. Another good indicator: if you&rsquo;re a recruiter! Based on hundreds of recruiter emails it seems that recruiters aren&rsquo;t offering the coolest jobs a company has to offer.</p>

<p>Software interviews are grueling. What are you doing to help me with that?</p>

<p>Too many recruiters seem to get paid to connect job-seekers and businesses, which seems to boil down to forwarding job postings to anyone they can find. Job postings are really easy to find and job-seekers seem really easy to find, so what value does a recruiter add?</p>

<p>If I were to ever work with a recruiter I would want them to show respect. Don&rsquo;t treat people like interchangeable parts or paychecks.</p>

<p>My initial hypothesis was that recruiters are mostly sending the same email making them hard to differentiate. Recruiters should work hard to be different.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t say you used to be a &lsquo;techie.&rsquo; If you were, it should be obvious in the interaction. Beyond that, techies don&rsquo;t have to be programmers, they come from all walks of life; for example, my wife is a techie educator and I&rsquo;ve met plenty of techie musicians. If you used to be a programmer, you might have cred for a couple years, but that wears off quickly as the industry changes so quickly. Also, if you tell me you used to be a programmer then I immediately wonder why you left: were you bad? does recruiting pay better, and if so, are you just in it for the money?</p>

<p>Have the hiring manager or a recruiting engineer send the job description. I react much better to someone whose title is &ldquo;Senior Software Engineering&rdquo; than to someone whose title is &ldquo;Recruiter, SPHR, MBA, PMP, CIR, CSP, Esq.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Very often, the email would contain job requirements saying things like &ldquo;Django expertise a must.&rdquo; I&rsquo;ve played with Django, but I am by no means an expert&ndash;and I can&rsquo;t find anything that connects me with Django (beyond a tenuous link through Python). That leaves me wondering if the job actually requires Django expertise or if the recruiters are setting me up to fail. Either way, I&rsquo;m not left with a good feeling.</p>

<p>One simple piece of advice: sell something besides a boring job description; people are motivated by mastery, autonomy, purpose, money, commute, calibre of their peers, the ability to work on new features (or improve legacy systems), the ability to work with new technology (hint: Java 1.5 is not new technology). I think you get what you put in, so a company offering a boring job will get boring, workaday people.</p>

<p>Candidates have to differentiate themselves, so why don&rsquo;t recruiters? Here are a few ideas:</p>

<ul>
<li>offer to buy me dinner at my favorite restaurant</li>
<li>send me an amazon gift card via email</li>
<li>stimulate me on multiple levels</li>
<li>conducting business over email and IM</li>
<li>open with code or a puzzle</li>
<li>stop asking me to forward the message to everyone I know</li>
</ul>


<p>Also, you know how Google can automatically identify spam? A smart recruiter would create a simple recruiter classifier and ensure that their emails pass through the filter.</p>

<p>Here are a couple simple examples of recruiter pitches that would pique my interest:</p>

<pre>def main() {
   if ( you.are(happyInYourCurrentRole) ) {
        you = lucky;
   } else {
        letsChat();
   }
}
def letsChat() {
    if ( email || linkedIn ) {
        reply();
    } elsif ( phone ) {
        justSayWhen();
    }
}</pre>


<p>Or</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hey, Seth. I really like your website! You seem to have deep technical knowledge as well as a keen sense of design and usability. Knowing the best programmers, such as yourself, is my business; please enjoy an $25 Amazon gift card and keep me in mind when you&rsquo;re ready for a new job.&rdquo;</p>

      <p><a title="Akismet comment spam protection" href="http://akismet.com/">Akismet</a> does a good job of preventing most spam comments from showing up on my blog; however, a new style of comment is getting by the filter. Essentially, the comments will flatter the blog in a vague yet realistic manner. Below are some recent samples that I had to mark myself&ndash;they&rsquo;re remarkably similar to some comments that I have not marked as spam.</p>

<blockquote>Hello there. Cool site!! Guy.. Stunning.. Terrific.. My goal is to bookmark your online site along with take the enters additionally…I am happy to find many useful information in this article within the post. I would like to show some gratitude to sharing…</blockquote>


<blockquote>Hey there superb blog! Does running a blog such as this take a lot of work?
I’ve absolutely no expertise in programming but I had been hoping to start my own blog in the near future. Anyhow, should you have any suggestions or tips for new blog owners please share. I understand this is off subject nevertheless I simply needed to ask. Thanks a lot!</blockquote>


<blockquote>I just couldn’t depart your website prior to suggesting that I

actually enjoyed the standard info a person provide for your visitors? Is going to be back often in

order to check up on new posts</blockquote>


<p>The differentiators I&rsquo;ve found: spam comments will include a URL, name, or email that is related to selling something, while genuine comments often lack a URL and have name and email that are closely related (e.g., commenter Foo Bar would have an email address like <a href="&#109;&#x61;&#x69;&#108;&#x74;&#111;&#x3a;&#102;&#111;&#x6f;&#64;&#98;&#97;&#114;&#46;&#x63;&#111;&#x6d;">&#102;&#111;&#x6f;&#64;&#98;&#97;&#114;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;</a>).</p>

<p>I guess spammers figure the comments are free to post (posted by bots), so why not?</p>

      <p>I completed my PhD in May 2011. My dissertation, <a title="Simplifying the Programming of Intelligent Environments at UT Library" href="http://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/handle/2152/ETD-UT-2011-05-3368">Simplifying the Programming of Intelligent Environments</a>, was basically about making home automation usable. Below is the abstract.</p>

<h3>Abstract</h3>


<p>In the future, computers will be virtually everywhere: carried by everyone and integrated into the environment. The increased computation and communication capabilities will enable intelligent environments that react to occupants through automated decision-making. Devices (sensors and actuators) are the key to making intelligent environments a reality. We believe that devices must be made more approachable for average users. Existing approaches to application development for intelligent environments require detailed knowledge about devices and their low-leveling programming interfaces, which greatly limits the number of potential users. Instead of limiting users, we must enable everyone to program the devices around them. Intelligent environments will not be commonplace until average people can set up and manage the hardware and software necessary for their personalized applications.</p>

<p>In simplifying the programming of intelligent environments, we ?rst made sensors and actuators accessible to average programmers then extended our work to end-users. We term the former contribution Sensor Enablement for Average Programmers (SEAP); the latter work is Sensor Enablement for End-Users (SEEU). In our experience, devices’ disparate, niche programming languages and communication protocols presented great di?culty in developing intelligent environments. To ease the development e?ort for average  programmers, we abstracted and standardized complex sensor and actuator  interactions, allowing users to instead think in terms of well-understood web applications. Users have said that SEAP is easy-to-use and exciting. But what about average people, end-users?</p>

<p>We found that end-users are incredibly interested in intelligent environments. By engaging end-users we can create intelligent environments even faster and allow domain experts to tailor their environment. This dissertation’s second contribution, Sensor Enablement for End-Users (SEEU) provides a visual programming interface that allows users to create personalized automated behaviors given available devices and data. We performed several user studies to uncover people’s desires for intelligent environments and determine the best interface for managing an intelligent environment. SEEU combines an intuitive interface with the power and ?exibility of SEAP. SEEU is a usable end-user programming framework that allows average people to create useful applications for their intelligent environments.</p>

<p>With SEEU and SEAP, we simpli?ed the development of intelligent  environments, reducing barriers to adoption of emerging sensing and actuation technologies. We demonstrated the feasability with a series of user studies.</p>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/when-to-use-the-phd-suffix/">When to use the PhD suffix</a></h1>
      <p>I struggle with when to include the PhD suffix. I try not to flaunt my degree, but I worked hard and want the PhD to be worth something&ndash;that means I can&rsquo;t downplay it. Work is one place where degrees (might) matter. There are potential downsides to using the PhD at work though.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s roughly when I include (marked yes) or omit (marked no) the PhD:</p>

<ul>
<li>Resume: yes</li>
<li>Email signature: yes</li>
<li>Business card: yes</li>
<li>Presentations (title slide): yes</li>
<li>LinkedIn: no</li>
<li>Name tags: no</li>
<li>Verbal introductions: no</li>
</ul>


<p>Does that seem reasonable to you? Have a missed a situation? I suppose the tried-and-true advice is &ldquo;know your audience&rdquo; and use the PhD when it will be advantageous.</p>

      <p>This weekend I wrote <a title="Seth Holloway: Rhythm test" href="http://sethholloway.com/timing.html">a simple webpage to measure the accuracy of my rhythm</a> (the <a title="GitHub: JavaScript timing project" href="https://github.com/smholloway/miscellaneous/tree/master/javascript/timing">timing project on GitHub</a>). Just load the page then start tapping any key(s) periodically; the page records and reports on the time between key-presses.</p>

<p>In playing with the page my standard deviation normally hovered around 20ms, drifting up towards 40ms. This was without a metronome.</p>

<p>Open questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>What is a good accuracy?</li>
<li>How long should a rhythm test last? Five seconds seems too short and five minutes seems too long.</li>
<li>Am I reporting the proper statistics?</li>
<li>Is my quick attempt at measuring rhythm flawed? JavaScript may be too slow or imprecise. Are there bugs?</li>
<li>How can the app be improved?</li>
</ul>


<p>How&rsquo;s your accuracy? Got any ideas? Please let me know!</p>
