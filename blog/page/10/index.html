      <h1 class="link"><a href="/features-i-wish-netflix-would-add/">Features I wish Netflix would add</a></h1>
      <p>Preface: I like Netflix, and I&rsquo;ve been happily using the service for years.</p>

<p>When Netflix changed their service last year, a lot of people quit using the service. To this day, I feel that Netflix has lost customers and is succeeding due in part to their monopoly. Too many other companies can compete in the streaming video business (or they think they can, at least); however, <a title="Wikipedia - Netflix Prize" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix_Prize">Netflix has an amazing algorithm to predict how much you will like a movie</a>. If I were a product manager for Netflix I would showcase the ranking system and add a few new features to improve the user experience, rebuild the brand, and differentiate from the competition.</p>

<p>Before I discuss the features I would like to see added, let me explain a bit about how I use Netflix. I watch Netflix almost exclusively on my TV connected to my PS3. My tastes are pretty diverse and I watch all kinds of content (educational TV shows to samurai movies). My queue has contained over 50 items for almost as long as I&rsquo;ve had Netflix.</p>

<p>With that in mind, here are a few features that would improve my Netflix experience:</p>

<p><strong>Sorting</strong>. When looking at a list of movies, it would be nice to be able to sort, particularly by stars. Netflix has so much content! I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll stoop to the 1 or 2 star level anytime soon, so show those items last, or not at all. Showcase the ranking algorithm that can predict what I&rsquo;ll like!</p>

<p><strong>Filtering</strong>. Filtering is an extension to sorting, I think. With all the content, it is hard to wade through everything. As I said with sorting, I don&rsquo;t plan to watch movies below 3 stars, so let me filter those out. I&rsquo;m also not a fan of old movies, in general, so it would be nice to nix anything before some date. Often, I fire up Netflix with a vague notion of what I want to watch, but nothing particular in mind; it would be nice to find movies based on tags or multiple genres (like comedy and action). For example, one of our common searches boils down to a comedy made in the last 10 years; unfortunately, we have to keep those criteria in mind as we look through various queues (instant, comedy, new releases, recently added). I think there&rsquo;s ample precedent of filtering interfaces (particularly in shopping sites like Amazon, Old Navy, Newegg, etc), so users would have little resistance to this change.</p>

<p><strong>Guided decision making</strong>. Why not help people find something good to watch? The interface does a pretty good job of presenting a subset of content, but the sheer number of options can be overwhelming. This leads to choice-paralysis where it&rsquo;s easier to watch nothing than to decide on the hundreds of options. To streamline the process, I would create a guided path that leads to a movie or a small subset of movies. For example, formalize the decision making process that is something like this: &ldquo;I want a [classic|modern|new] [choose genre] [choose sub-genre] movie that is [short|medium|long].&rdquo; This would also allow the user to find deeper content as well (the content that doesn&rsquo;t fit in the 75 item lists shown in the current interface).</p>

<p><strong>Intermediate &ldquo;staging&rdquo; area</strong>. Almost every time I have turned on Netflix I&rsquo;ve scrolled through my queue trying to find something to watch. I&rsquo;ll find maybe five items then decide what to watch off the short list. When watching with other people, we generally reach a group decision based on everyone&rsquo;s input (Person A is game for &ldquo;The Big Lebowski,&rdquo; Person B wants to watch &ldquo;Snatch,&rdquo; and I&rsquo;m feeling &ldquo;Låt den rätte komma in&rdquo;). This is another instance where a computer could assist effortlessly, but I have to hold all the information in my head.</p>

<p>There are other things Netflix could do (like increasing the amount and quality of content), but I think the above features could be easily achieved and provide a lot of bang for the buck.</p>

<p>What features do you think are missing? Do you use Netflix like I do? What would you like to see added or improved?</p>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/i-dont-want-to-install-your-app/">I don&#8217;t want to install your app</a></h1>
      <p>I am getting tired of sites pushing their iPhone app while I am browsing on my iPhone! I&rsquo;m a minimalist, and I&rsquo;d prefer to have a small subset of useful apps. Here&rsquo;s a made up example that is very similar to what I&rsquo;ve encountered multiple times recently: I&rsquo;ll search for something simple like &ldquo;native plants in central texas,&rdquo; which will lead me to a site like Uncle Jim&rsquo;s Country Nursery and Feed Store (just an example&mdash;this site did not exist at the time of writing); the page load is interrupted by a modal dialog asking me to install their iPhone app. No! I don&rsquo;t want to install your app! I just want to see if this page has the information I&rsquo;m seeking (often, it does not).</p>

<p>While tablets and mobile devices will be the primary computer in the near future, I believe the web is the right way forward. There are at least two major mobile platforms (iOS and Android, not to mention Windows, BlackBerry, and any future platforms) requiring dramatically different applications. On the other hand, pursuing a web strategy requires only one app&mdash;an app that you need regardless of whether or not you create an app. My advice as a technologist (and my preference as a user) is to pour your efforts into making a solid website.</p>

      <p>Google Plus has been out for a while now, and, after giving it a try, I feel it&rsquo;s fair to say I preferred the Google Reader approach to social. Google Reader was central to my news consumption because I could keep track of hundreds of feeds and take advantage of social filtering (why subscribe to Lifehacker when a few people I follow share the stories I would have cared about?). In addition to excellent features as a news reader, I could kill endless amounts of time by commenting on others&#8217; shared posts.</p>

<p>With the introduction of Google Plus, Google removed the social aspects of Google Reader that were so engaging for me: (1) the ability to follow people and see their shared posts and (2) the ability to have conversations about those shared posts.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m largely underwhelmed by Plus and feel the void left by stripping down Google Reader. Sadly, I&rsquo;m not sure that any news reader can capture the same spirit, even if they can copy the features. And no company is likely to start on such a project given the lack of monetization. Oh well! It was good while it lasted&hellip;</p>

      <p>Passwords are simply not secure as evidenced by numerous password breaches and numerous hacks. Identity theft is increasingly common and increasingly harmful, so we need to evolve our security sooner rather than later. <a title="Wikipedia: two factor authentication" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-factor_authentication" target="_blank">Multi factor authentication</a> is a great way to improve security. In essence, we would augment our current password system with an additional factor (something the user possesses&mdash;like an RSA token or ATM card&mdash;or something unique to the user&rsquo;s person&mdash;like a fingerprint or retina scan).</p>

<p>Already, many companies distribute <a title="Two factor authentication - token generators" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-factor_authentication#Tokens_with_a_display_.28disconnected_tokens.29" target="_blank">RSA fobs</a> that cycle through a unique series of numbers; whenever an employee logs in with the correct password, a secondary check is issued and requires that the user input the number from the RSA device. A few banks offer this system, and <a title="Google offers two factor authentication" href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/02/advanced-sign-in-security-for-your.html" target="_blank">Google brought the same idea to their authentication system</a>.</p>

<p>Recently, I started using the Google system and I&rsquo;m pleased overall; however, I know that we can do better. Why require the user to type in an ever-changing key when we can get at that information another way? That is, use the user&rsquo;s phone to verify their location and only allow logins from known locations.</p>

<p>That simple idea is the basis of a company started by my friend and grad school peer, Evan. <a title="Two factor authentication done right " href="https://www.toopher.com/" target="_blank">Toopher</a> is two factor authentication made easy. For my convenience and security, I hope that sites use Toopher!</p>

      <p>TL;DR: If you see &ldquo;PWAT N AUSTIN MOTO AUSTIN TX&rdquo; on your statement, it&rsquo;s probably Painting with a Twist (PWAT).</p>

<p>Looking over my credit card statement I saw &ldquo;PWAT N AUSTIN MOTO AUSTIN TX&rdquo; and had no idea what it was. The random words made no sense to me. To make it even more confusing, my bank was categorizing the company as &ldquo;Organizations &ndash; MISC SCHOOLS / EDUCATIONAL SERVICES&rdquo;</p>

<p>Searching for the entire string led to results that were really keyed in on &ldquo;MOTO AUSTIN&rdquo; for some reason, which led to a lot of dead ends (we did not pay for motorcycle lessons or rent a motorcycle!).</p>

<p>After more searching I realized this charge is for <a title="Painting with a Twist" href="http://www.paintingwithatwist.com/">Painting With A Twist</a>! With that said, Painting With A Twist is a lot of fun. Andrea and I were able to quickly create some decent looking paintings in a relaxed environment.</p>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/my-experience-with-programming-languages/">My experience with programming languages</a></h1>
      <p>I was recently browsing a <a title="Rosetta Code: Programming Languages" href="http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Category:Programming_Languages">list of programming languages on Rosetta Code</a> (there&rsquo;s a <a title="Wikipedia: List of Programming Languages" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_programming_languages">larger list on Wikipedia</a>) and realized I have played with a lot of languages over the years. I decided to make a list here:</p>

<ul>
<li>Apex (Salesforce.com)</li>
<li>AppleScript</li>
<li>Assembly (I forget the exact flavors, but there have been a few embedded chips like the Motorola 6812, the LC-2 teaching language, and some in-line C on various AMD and Intel chips)</li>
<li>AutoHotKey</li>
<li>AWK</li>
<li>BASIC</li>
<li>Batch</li>
<li>C</li>
<li>C++</li>
<li>C#</li>
<li>Clojure</li>
<li>CoffeeScript</li>
<li>F#</li>
<li>Gnuplot</li>
<li>Go</li>
<li>Groovy</li>
<li>Haskell</li>
<li>Java</li>
<li>JavaScript</li>
<li>LabVIEW</li>
<li>LaTeX</li>
<li>Lisp</li>
<li>LotusScript</li>
<li>Lua</li>
<li>Make</li>
<li>Mathematica</li>
<li>MATLAB</li>
<li>MySQL</li>
<li>Objective-C</li>
<li>Octave</li>
<li>Pascal</li>
<li>Perl</li>
<li>PHP</li>
<li>Python</li>
<li>R</li>
<li>Ruby</li>
<li>Scala</li>
<li>Scratch</li>
<li>Sed</li>
<li>SQL</li>
<li>TI-89 BASIC</li>
<li>UNIX Shell (sh, Bash) and UNIX Pipes (grep, cat, etc)</li>
<li>VBScript</li>
<li>VHDL</li>
</ul>


<p>I haven&rsquo;t written extensively in all of the languages and I doubt I could do much more than &lsquo;Hello, World!&rsquo; (if that) in most, but those are the ones that I remember.</p>

<p>There are a few more that I didn&rsquo;t see while quickly browsing the languages list. For example, I have automated video game playing in the past using languages like UOAssist, Razor, AC Tools, and MMOGlider. One summer at Texas Instruments I wrote statistical algorithms and data mining routines for a specialized spreadsheet language called Informix Wingz/HyperScript Tools/DataPOWER (which now seems to be owned by IBM).</p>

<p>Looking back, I&rsquo;ve written in a fair amount of languages, but there&rsquo;s so much to learn and do! I continue to learn and grow as I add links to my <a title="Craftsman chain of improvement" href="http://japhr.blogspot.com/2009/03/my-chain.html">craftsman&rsquo;s chain</a>. My next step is to complete the Programming Languages 101 online course from <a title="Dr. Nathan Whitehead teaches programming languages" href="http://nathansuniversity.com/">Nathan&rsquo;s University</a>. Very cool stuff!</p>

<p>Update: added Assembly and UNIX shell specifics. Added Clojure and Lisp. Added Scala and F#.</p>

      <p>Near the end of 2011 I decided to try a vegetarian diet for a few reasons, including the fact that I don&rsquo;t really care for meat, red and processed meats may cause cancer, I generally wanted to eat healthier, and it&rsquo;d be nice to lower my carbon footprint. Okay, technically it was not vegetarianism, rather my diet was <a title="Wikipedia: Pescetarianism" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pescetarianism">pescatarianism</a>, and more accurately, <a title="Wikipedia: Flexitarianism" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-vegetarianism">flexitarianism</a> (I&rsquo;ve been largely vegetarian, but chosen to eat meat a few times&mdash;mainly when I was really hungry).  After three months, here are some observations (in no particular order):</p>

<ul>
<li>Everyone has thoughts on food and diet. Many people want to understand and define your diet, and they are quick to point out when you&rsquo;re inconsistent (&ldquo;Sushi?! Aren&rsquo;t you a vegetarian?!&rdquo;). Several overweight people told me that my choice was wrong or bad.</li>
<li>A lot of people mocked vegetarianism, which is somewhat understandable because <a title="Wikipedia: Vegetarianism by country" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetarianism_by_country">only about 1/30 people in the US are vegetarian</a>.</li>
<li>I actually prefer veggie burgers to traditional meat patties. Veggie burgers can have better flavor and texture than meat patties. As with the old stand-by (beef), there are good and bad versions, but veggie patties have more complexity (probably because of the mixture of ingredients).</li>
<li>Most of the time it&rsquo;s pretty easy to be a vegetarian; it is far harder to be a healthy vegetarian. Several times I found myself eating queso or french fries instead of a lower calorie, arguably healthier entree with lean meat. There are a lot of vegetarian options around Austin and most restaurants will provide some meatless alternative, but eating roasted veggies or a bland salad while others chow down on a scrumptious entree just sucks!</li>
<li>Sometimes it&rsquo;s nearly impossible to be a vegetarian. A few places just have no vegetarian options! BBQ places may leave you eating nothing but bread&mdash;and some only have bread made with lard, so you&rsquo;re left with pickles and onions. In general, ethnic food seems friendlier to the meat-averse. If you&rsquo;re really disciplined you can pack your own food, skip a meal, or demand that you go somewhere else.</li>
<li>Animal derived products exist in unexpected places! For example, one of my favorite local Tex-Mex restaurants, Chuy&rsquo;s, uses chicken broth in their queso. As I alluded to above, some places use lard in their bread. A lot of soups and sauces use chicken or beef stock. There&rsquo;s meat or meat flavoring in beans&mdash;even traditional caesar salad dressing (anchovies). I rarely inquired as to how vegetarian food items were, choosing instead to go off my previous knowledge as well as the food&rsquo;s appearance and description.</li>
<li>Meat eaters also like vegetarian meals. If you eat a family-style meal a lot of people will eat your food even though you choose not to eat theirs! For example, everyone orders a pizza (most have meat) then cheese is the first flavor finished.</li>
</ul>


<p>That&rsquo;s it for now. Did I miss something? Has anyone else experienced something different?</p>

      <p><a title="The Absolute Minimum Every Software Developer Absolutely, Positively Must Know About Unicode and Character Sets (No Excuses!)" href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/Unicode.html">Joel Spoelsky&rsquo;s article on what developers should know</a> motivated me to learn a bit about <a title="Wikipedia: Unicode" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode">Unicode</a> characters. To explore this awesome encoding I wrote a little <a title="Seth Holloway's HTML experiment with unicode" href="https://github.com/smholloway/miscellaneous/blob/master/javascript/funWithUnicode.html">JavaScript to print out all the Unicode characters</a>. It is interesting to note where you have significant gaps of blank white blocks with black borders (this shows what character sets you lack&mdash;sorry, I have not noted which set is displayed in the page). Be patient: the page takes a few seconds to run.</p>
