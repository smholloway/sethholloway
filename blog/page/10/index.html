      <hr />

<pre><code>if ( foo.equals("bar") ) { // ... }
</code></pre>

<p>Here, foo may be null, so instead use</p>

<pre><code>if ( "bar".equals(foo) ) { // ... }
</code></pre>

<p>This pattern generalizes to using the equals method of the concrete object (put the non-null object on the left side).</p>

<hr />

<p>You can use instanceof to ensure an object is the proper type (this can replace a null check), as in</p>

<pre><code>if ( arg1 instanceof String ) { // ... }
</code></pre>

<hr />

<p>As of Java 1.5 you can declare methods with variable arity, making the syntax a little cleaner and invocation a bit simpler. The old style:</p>

<pre><code>public static void main(String[] args)
</code></pre>

<p>becomes</p>

<pre><code>public static void main(String... args)
</code></pre>

<p>which can then be called like this:</p>

<pre><code>main("seth", "for", "president")
</code></pre>

<hr />

<p>Errors and Exceptions derive from Throwable, so you can catch all program hiccups by catching Throwable instead of Exception (or Error).</p>

<hr />

<p>Local variables are not initialized with a value; field variables are initialized like so:</p>

<p>Number primitives default to 0.</p>

<p>Objects (Collections) default to null.</p>

<p>Booleans default to false.</p>

<hr />

<p>Java has labels, but most people will not appreciate their inclusion and use. For example, the following code is valid Java</p>

<pre><code>http://www.sethholloway.com
</code></pre>

<hr />

<p>In mixed-type computation, Java upconverts to the larger data type due to widening primitive conversion. Avoid mixed-type computation and comparisons.</p>

<hr />

<p>&ldquo;Although common, the idiom <code>object.getClass().getMethod("methodName")</code> is broken and should not be used.&rdquo; &ndash; <a title="Java Puzzlers sampler" href="http://javapuzzlers.com/java-puzzlers-sampler.pdf">Java Puzzlers sample</a></p>

<hr />

<p>The finally block of a try-catch-finally will always execute (unless there&rsquo;s a hard crash, System.exit(), System.halt(), or infinite loop before). As such, be careful with returns and mutating objects in the try and finally.</p>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/choosing-the-right-library-for-your-java-project/">Choosing the right library for your Java project</a></h1>
      <p>Software libraries can tremendously help software development. At best, the libraries are well tested pieces of functionality that integrate easily into your project and prevent you from re-inventing the wheel. On the negative side, third-party libraries could add to your costs or prevent your company from being sold, they could be confusing and poorly documented, or they could work unexpectedly. I&rsquo;ve used a number of libraries in the past (Ruby and Ruby on Rails push libraries heavily; in Java I like jsoup and log4j), but I was curious how pros chose so I asked around and searched a bit.</p>

<p>You can read the <a title="Reddit: Handy Java Libraries" href="http://www.reddit.com/r/java/comments/kis7l/handy_java_libraries_you_use">Reddit take on handy Java libraries</a>.</p>

<p>And here&rsquo;s advice from Lane:</p>

<blockquote>I&#8217;d focus on these:

Normal coding
Apache Commons: <a href="http://commons.apache.org/" target="_blank">http://commons.apache.org/</a>
Guava: <a href="http://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/" target="_blank">http://code.google.com/p/<wbr>guava-libraries/</wbr></a>
Jackson JSON parser: <a href="http://jackson.codehaus.org/" target="_blank">http://jackson.codehaus.org/</a>
Spring: <a href="http://www.springsource.org/" target="_blank">http://www.springsource.org/</a>
ActiveMQ

Unit Testing:
jUnit4
Hamcrest matchers
Mockito (I absolutely dislike mocking tho)

When it comes to libraries try to find ones that have a lot of current activity.

The best code is the code you don&#8217;t have to write.  So I try to write
as little as possible.</blockquote>


<p>And Drew:</p>

<blockquote>
<div>Here are a couple considerations off the top of my head, but by no means are these exhaustive nor complete&#8230;</div>
<div>Quick summary - Choosing to use a library should be economics driven.  Look at ROI.  Yes, for an engineer, the excitement of using the newest cool tool is a positive return, but only one of many 10&#8217;s of terms in the equation&#8230; and probably not one of the larger terms.</div>
<div>0) Documentation - Any library (or application) worth your time should have decent documentation.  It&#8217;s hard to recognize good documentation for new engineers, so beware things recommends by &#8220;kids&#8221;.  There are basically two camps on the documentation side&#8230; the big book (e.g. maven) and the mailing list (e.g. guava).  The big book is pretty obvious.  Guava&#8217;s documentation is a collection of power-point presentations and a very active tag on stack-overflow.  Personally, I prefer Guava&#8217;s documentation over the big-book style.</div>
<div>1) Maturity of library - Steer clear of anything that is a prototype, a &#8220;place to test advanced features&#8221;, etc.  It&#8217;s not worth your time to rewrite your code when the api changes.</div>
<div>2) Maturity of release - Steer clear of anything X.0.0.  It&#8217;s broken and you&#8217;ll have to upgrade soon&#8230; another time suck.  Given the choice between 3.5.2 and 4.0.0, always go with 3.x.</div>
<div>3) Client list - You&#8217;re looking for things that are used by other big projects.  slf4j does a good job of this&#8230; it&#8217;s a mid-aged library but they have a impressive list of projects that use the library right on the home page.  This is a good sign.</div>
<div>4) Consider proprietary libraries - Sometimes it makes a lot of sense to just buy it.  The price for these libraries is always stunning, but you need to consider ROI, not cost.  Your ROI calculation needs to include design, implementation, maintenance, time-to-market, and how pissed your customer will be if you got something wrong.  Odds are very good that a proprietary library has already gotten that thing wrong and is amortizing the cost.</div>
<div>Plus, it&#8217;s nice to have someone to call that has to answer your question.  No one has to answer your guava question (and there are a number of unanswered questions on SO).  I may sound strange, but it&#8217;s fantastic to get a reply from a vendor in a hour that says &#8220;I understand your question, but we don&#8217;t do that right now.&#8221;  You can then move on and never second guess that decision.</div>
<div>5) Legal - Never use anything that is GPL or LGPL only.  Apache, CDDL, BSD, and others are ok.  Most decent libraries are dual licensed.  Figure out which licenses are &#8216;ok&#8217; for yourself, don&#8217;t take my word for it.  Here&#8217;s the reason&#8230; at some point you might want to sell your idea/company to someone else.  If you have GPL libraries in your code base, it&#8217;s gonna cost you real money when you sell, and real time when you have to extract it after the sale.  I know you can use a GPL library and be safe&#8230; but it&#8217;s just too scary for people who might want to buy you later.  Now that&#8217;s not to say you can&#8217;t use GPL libraries to build your product.  We all have one or two GPL tools that we use&#8230; but they don&#8217;t get rolled into the final product (e.g. findbugs).</div>
<div>6) Generics - A sub-item for maturity probably, but a specific item to watch for.  If a library doesn&#8217;t use generics at all, it&#8217;s a red flag.  There are cases where it doesn&#8217;t make sense to accept types from the application, so the library doesn&#8217;t need generics&#8230; but this is pretty rare.  I would expect that a library would return at least one collection&#8230; and if that collection is untyped, it&#8217;s a flag that something is up.  (It could be backwards compatibility, unmaintained code, or authors that don&#8217;t &#8220;get it&#8221;, or something else)</div>
<div>7) Standards - Not so much.  I used to look for libraries that conformed to standards.  I don&#8217;t find that to be a big deal anymore.  If a library is worth its salt, it&#8217;s documented either via some standard or by itself.  (Tomcat and Jetty conform to standards wich is great.  Guava is non-standard, but I don&#8217;t care).</div>
<div>8) Beware libraries that have lots of dependencies.  Sometimes it&#8217;s unavoidable, but try to avoid them if possible.  They make the final product bigger (not a huge deal), they need more updates (again, you can avoid this most of the time), but the big one is library clashing. You don&#8217;t want to include a nice stable library X.jar that depends on a library Y.jar in 2010, then find out that you really would like to use the newest version of Y.jar directly, but it&#8217;s got a new API.  You may be able to upgrade X.jar to use the new Y.jar, but you&#8217;ll also be upgrading all the other libraries it depends on too.  Basically, library dependencies are not a tree, they&#8217;re a directed graph (acyclic if you&#8217;re lucky).  The bigger and more connected that graph is, the more problems that it can cause in the build system.</div>
<div>Summary) Basically, you should always be looking at ROI.  There&#8217;s just no way to compute the actual ROI, so you have to use your experience to make an approximation.  If two or three choices are about the same, then try to make a case for one of them in an email to yourself (or your boss).  See how easy it is to write up an argument to convince someone else.</div></blockquote>


<p>Who replied later with more information:</p>

<blockquote>
<div>I thought about it a little more today, and if I was going to write up a real article for the web, I might propose a ROI formula with a half-dozen terms&#8230; then describe how to evaluate a library for each term.  If I was lucky, I could pick terms that were really independent of each other.</div>
<div>Something like &#8220;cost to design + cost to build + cost to maintain &gt;? dollar cost for license + cost to integrate + (prob. of update)*(cost to apply update) + &#8230;&#8221;</div></blockquote>


<p>Excellent advice! Thanks to Drew and Lane!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m interested in other opinions. How do you choose a library? Which do you use most frequently? Have any horror stories derived from code reuse?</p>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/what-id-do-if-i-managed-angry-birds/">What I&#8217;d do if I managed Angry Birds</a></h1>
      <p>Angry Birds is a great game, and it is hugely popular. I would venture to say it is a platform (and I don&rsquo;t toss that term around lightly now that every startup is a &ldquo;viral platform&rdquo; :)). Platform elevates the status and allows&ndash;even forces&ndash;Rovio to change the way they approach Angry Birds. Here are a few things I&rsquo;d look to do if I managed Angry Birds.</p>

<ul>
<li>Take advantage of the robust platform: allow people to create levels&ndash;get people really involved in the game. Personally, I burn through the official levels in hours and then have to wait an unacceptable amount of time for new content. I play the new levels because there&rsquo;s nothing better out, but the moment I have other games then Angry Birds is out of sight and mind. User generated content is awesome! A number of other games flourished and increased their staying power when they allowed users to create new content (for example, StarCraft and Half-Life/Counter-Strike).</li>
<li>Allow people to create new game elements like birds, pigs, and environmental features. You could add more dynamic pieces like swinging ropes or sand dripping out of a vial.</li>
<li>Publish global leaderboards with incentives like badges and special skins, additional content.</li>
<li>Create a YouTube channel for Angry Birds. Did you know there are televised Starcraft games? It&rsquo;s a big deal. Show live footage of pros encountering new levels. Does the top player meticulously size up the level or just run and gun? These videos can help frustrated players get over the hump and defeat some levels.</li>
<li>Spin up forums and discussions for each level. Beyond text, I would allow (encourage) videos showing different strategies.</li>
<li>Look at scoring based on speed and precision: extreme Angry Birds.</li>
<li>Expand into multiplayer capabilities.</li>
<li>Keep rocking! I&rsquo;ve seen Angry Birds in commercials for pistachios and a phone, plus there are plush toys. Great marketing!</li>
</ul>


<p>Would you enjoy any of these features? What would you do if you managed Angry Birds?</p>

      <p>In JavaScript, if on a non-boolean input will check existence. In Ruby, the same test will also check for existence with &ldquo;&rdquo; considered true; you receive a warning (warning: string literal in condition). Python performs like JavaScript. In Java, you receive a type error (Type mismatch: cannot convert from String to boolean). I show the output from JavaScript console, irb, python, and Java.</p>

<p>JavaScript</p>

<pre>&gt; if ("false") { console.log("true"); } else { console.log("false"); }
true</pre>


<pre>&gt; if ("") { console.log("true"); } else { console.log("false"); }
false</pre>


<p>Ruby</p>

<pre>puts "false" ? "true" : "false"
(irb):4: warning: string literal in condition
true</pre>


<pre>&gt; puts "" ? "true" : "false"
(irb):1: warning: string literal in condition
true</pre>


<p>Python</p>

<pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; if ("false"):
...     print "true"
... else:
...     print "false"
...
true</pre>


<pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; if (""):
...     print "true"
... else:
...     print "false"
...
false</pre>


<p>Java</p>

<pre>if ("false") {
    System.out.println("true");
} else {
    System.out.println("false");
}

Exception in thread "main" java.lang.Error: Unresolved compilation problem:
Type mismatch: cannot convert from String to boolean</pre>


<p>No matter how the language handles it, it&rsquo;s bad coding style because of erratic behavior. Save the next programmer some grief and specify the full expression whose truthiness you are seeking.</p>

<hr />

<p>JavaScript is not multi-threaded; the spec does not specify any threading or synchronization. JavaScript in modern browsers is single-threaded. Handling multiple actions at once is done by firing off functions and waiting for callbacks.</p>

<hr />

<p>In Java, the default equals method will compare the memory location of two objects; the default hashcode implementation will return the memory address.</p>

<hr />

<p>In Java, all data structures in Collections offer a method, size(), to access the data structure&rsquo;s size. Primitive arrays have a property, length (note the difference in name and method vs property). Strings use a method, length(), to make things more confusing!</p>

<pre>List&lt;Integer&gt; list = new ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt;();
System.out.println(list.size());
0</pre>


<pre>int array[] = new int[10];
System.out.println(array.length);
10</pre>


<pre>String string = new String();
System.out.println(string.length());
0</pre>


<hr />

<p>One way to implement a fixed-size cache is to store elements twice: one in a hash map and one in a linked list. To add an element, first check size; if you&rsquo;re at capacity, remove the oldest element (the head of the linked list) from both structures, then insert the element into both data structures (at the end of the linked list and at the proper location in the hash map). This can be done in constant time. The contains() method is a simple hash map look-up in constant time. This data structure optimizes overall run time [O(n)] at the cost of storing elements twice.</p>

      <p>A friend of mine mentioned that he didn&rsquo;t like Gmail&rsquo;s built-in tasks, which prompted me to share a couple Chrome extensions (they exist for Firefox too) that I have come to enjoy. Here they</p>

<ul>
<li><a title="TaskForce to-do list in Gmail" href="https://www.taskforceapp.com/">TaskForce</a> - a task list that&rsquo;s a little better than Google&rsquo;s default</li>
<li><a title="Rapportive - replace ads with useful information" href="http://rapportive.com/">Rapportive</a> - replaces the right sidebar ads with information about the person you&rsquo;re emailing&ndash;awesome!</li>
<li><a title="Klout for Rapportive" href="http://kloutlet.com/">Klout raplet</a> - adds the recipient&rsquo;s Klout score at the bottom of the Rapportive sidebar. (Klout is a way of measuring a person&rsquo;s influence on Twitter.)</li>

      <p>There are myriad ways to optimize a program, but you can go a long way with three rhyming concepts:</p>

<p><a title="Wikipedia: Cache" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache">cache</a> -  Perform operations once then store them; you trade memory for speed and reduced access to database (for example).</p>

<p><a title="Wikipedia: Hash table" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table">hash</a> -  Hash maps are fast and efficient for a lot of algorithms; for example, a trie (suffix tree) is faster when implemented as a hash map than as a tree (because insertions and lookup are constant time on average with a hash map but log(n) for trees).</p>

<p><a title="Wikipedia: Thrashing" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrashing_(computer_science)">thrash</a> -  Avoid competing for resources, as in database or hard drive lookups.</p>

<p>I thought cache, hash, and thrash was a neat mnemonic. Do you have another go-to for optimizations? Know any other neat mnemonics?</p>

      <p>I received a lot of great feedback after <a title="Seth Holloway: Asking for feedback on summer 2011 resume" href="http://sethholloway.com/blog/2011/09/08/summer-2011-resume/">putting my resume online and asking for help</a>. Thanks for the help everyone! As <a title="NPR: Kevin Kelly reads his essay" href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=18463814">Kevin Kelly might say</a>, &ldquo;the universe is conspiring to help us.&rdquo; Below I outline what I did and why.</p>

<ul>
<li>Name: no PhD&ndash;just Seth Michael Holloway. Since the PhD is not needed for the job, the consensus was that the suffix would do more harm than good.</li>
<li>Retooled the summary to combine summary and objective. At first I removed the sections altogether because I thought it was wasted space that can hurt more than it can help. A friend convinced me that this one section grabs the reader&rsquo;s attention and draws them in. Now that you have their attention, do something good with it, like tell them your relevant skills!</li>
<li>I put the skills section below the new summary and broke skills into &ldquo;technologies&rdquo; and &ldquo;general&rdquo; subsections. A skills section allow busy people to determine my experience without having to read everything below. If the reader is interested in my skills after reading the summary, I&rsquo;m doing well.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m a recent grad so education stays up top and comes next. &ldquo;So Seth&rsquo;s summary matches our desired candidate as do his skills; he&rsquo;s educated&hellip; where has he worked?&rdquo; And that leads to work experience.</li>
<li>I cleaned up bullet points and job experience as the resume constantly evolves!</li>
<li>One big change in the experience section is the inclusion of &ldquo;intern&rdquo; in titles held during school. College kids are expected to have internship experience, so admitting a job was an internship does not hurt. These positions show that I balanced work and school. I had a hard time deciding on my most recent IBM job because I ended up owning a decent sized project that was important to several teams worldwide&ndash;hardly your standard internship! I felt like a part-timer, but intern is more self-explanatory.</li>
<li>Everyone said to shorten, so I removed a couple jobs and moved the interesting bits into the skills and clubs sections. The awards and honors section is out.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve left publications because they don&rsquo;t make a difference in length right now (over 2 pages with or without). Those publications show that I&rsquo;m well on my way to my 10,000 hours of writing (Gladwell&rsquo;s assertion that expertise takes 10,000 hours), and I&rsquo;m proud of the quality. I need to work on a blog post or alternate resume that shows the number of hours I&rsquo;ve put into various fields&hellip;</li>
<li>That&rsquo;s about it. The resume spills onto three pages, and I&rsquo;m okay with that for now. I have something between a CV and a resume! I figure that later sections are just a cookie for anyone dedicated enough to read that far :) One day I&rsquo;ll get down to 1 or 2 pages&hellip;</li>
</ul>


<div>I hope my thought process makes sense and that people like the <a title="Seth Holloway's awesome resume" href="http://sethholloway.com/resume.html">resume</a>. I really appreciate the help and know that I&#8217;ll find a great job as a result. If you have any other suggestions or see a flaw in my logic, please let me know.</div>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/advertising-on-linkedin-sucks/">Advertising on LinkedIn (Sucks)</a></h1>
      <p>As part of creating a business page for <a title="Oilfield Intel: oil and gas service and equipment reviews" href="http://oilfieldintelligence.com">Oilfield Intelligence</a> (a niche review site for oil and gas services and equipment), LinkedIn kindly provided $50 worth of credit for their ads. That was enough to entice me, so I set up the ads. Four pages: create your ads, choose your target audience, select pay for impressions or clicks, and input payment information.</p>

<p>At first I chose to pay per click (CPC), but they were charging close to $5.00 per. Ouch! We do not have metrics for how much a single visitor is worth, but I suspect it is much less than $5.00 each and that&rsquo;s if we had 100% conversion rate. Normal consumer web apps run around 1% conversion rate, so you&rsquo;d need 100 people on your page before one signed up. At $5.00 per person, that&rsquo;s $500 per new account. Yikes! Unfortunately, by the time I had done the math and researched a bit more, my LinkedIn session had expired (really? log me out in a few minutes?).</p>

<p>So, I return to the page and recreate the ads, choose who I want to target, choose PPC, and hit next. It&rsquo;s a payment form, and I owe them $5 for setting up my account! At this point I&rsquo;m feeling like I got the bait-and-switch: $50 &ldquo;free advertising&rdquo; for a $5 sign-up is a good deal, but it felt shady. I&rsquo;m looking to see where I can set the limit on ad spending so I don&rsquo;t have to pay anything out-of-pocket (it&rsquo;s only an experiment, so I don&rsquo;t want to shell out a lot of money before I can at least make a weak approximation at its value); there&rsquo;s nothing you can do to limit your spending, except set the limit per day and the number of days to run. Again, this feels rather shady since the minimum per day is $10 so they&rsquo;ll have me for $10 everyday that I forget to turn the advertising off. Ugh. &ldquo;Fine,&rdquo; I think, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go back and cap it at $10 per day for 5 days.&rdquo; The payment form has virtually no navigation. You can go forward (submit your information) or return to LinkedIn, but not back to the previous three pages. I press my back button and see the familiar &lsquo;resubmit form&rsquo; dialog. I click to resubmit and I&rsquo;m routed to the homepage&hellip;</p>

<p>A third time, I begin the ads process because nothing has been saved. I re-create the ads, re-target the ads, then adjust the costs and move on to payment information. Apparently something had been saved! After several minutes of duplicated effort, I find that I have already set-up my account and they just need my payment information. I&rsquo;m not sure why they could not tell me that on the first three pages.</p>

<p>This morning, I log in and check the report:</p>

<div>

<img class="size-medium wp-image-1479" title="OI-LinkedIn-Ad-Metrics" src="/images/OI-LinkedIn-Ads-300x30.png" alt="OI LinkedIn Ad Metrics" width="300" height="30" />

</div>


<p>They had served the ad almost 6,000 times! And of those 6,000 impressions, we received two clicks. LinkedIn estimates those clicks to be worth $6.16! Good thing I am only paying for impressions&hellip; I am paying for impressions, right? That screenshot says I&rsquo;ve spent $12.32. Checking the billing, I see this:</p>

<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-1480" title="OI-LinkedIn-Ad-Costs" src="/images/OI-LinkedIn-Ad-Costs-300x28.png" alt="OI LinkedIn Ad Costs" width="300" height="28" /></p>

<p>The image shows that I had spent $2.57, a number that I am baffled by. The other page says I&rsquo;ve spent $12.32 based on two clicks worth $6.16 each. $2.57 is closer to the cost per 1,000 impressions, but I never chose that budget. In one pass through the ad setup I agreed to pay around $3.50 per click (not $6.16); on another I agreed to pay $2.00 per 1,000 impressions (the lowest you can go); and on another pass it was $2.50 per 1,000 impressions. Never $2.57. Weird.</p>

<p>My initial impressions? Advertising on LinkedIn sucks. The site feels like an alpha release (as in not even ready for beta, much less a full product). The UI and information sharing is awful (how much have I actually spent and where did that number come from?). The setup is confusing. The navigation is weak. Perhaps worst of all, the ad placement is &ldquo;unobtrusive&rdquo; to put it nicely; more bluntly, the UI is cluttered and I cannot find the ads I&rsquo;m paying above market rates for. I plan to use up the $50 credit then abandon the platform until substantial upgrades are made.</p>

<p>Compared to Google: Google offered $100 worth of AdWords credit&ndash;twice what LinkedIn is willing to part with. My Google ads are costing $0.39 per click&ndash;over ten times less expensive than LinkedIn! Google&rsquo;s setup and reporting are markedly better.</p>

<p>Compared to Facebook: the <a title="Oilfield Intelligence on Facebook" href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Oilfield-Intelligence/256146977729169">OI Facebook page</a> seems to be ranked way higher than the <a title="Oilfield Intelligence official page on LinkedIn" href="http://www.linkedin.com/company/oilfield-intelligence">OI LinkedIn page</a>. I interpret that to mean that the Facebook page is a better use of our time than LinkedIn in general. Reading about ads, both LinkedIn and Facebook offer an abysmal 0.1% click-through-rate, so the cost per 1,000 impressions is usually equal to the cost per click.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll admit I&rsquo;m new to setting up CPC campaigns, but LinkedIn just seems bad. Am I missing something?</p>
