      <p>Angry Birds is a great game, and it is hugely popular. I would venture to say it is a platform (and I don&rsquo;t toss that term around lightly now that every startup is a &ldquo;viral platform&rdquo; :)). Platform elevates the status and allows&ndash;even forces&ndash;Rovio to change the way they approach Angry Birds. Here are a few things I&rsquo;d look to do if I managed Angry Birds.</p>

<ul>
<li>Take advantage of the robust platform: allow people to create levels&ndash;get people really involved in the game. Personally, I burn through the official levels in hours and then have to wait an unacceptable amount of time for new content. I play the new levels because there&rsquo;s nothing better out, but the moment I have other games then Angry Birds is out of sight and mind. User generated content is awesome! A number of other games flourished and increased their staying power when they allowed users to create new content (for example, StarCraft and Half-Life/Counter-Strike).</li>
<li>Allow people to create new game elements like birds, pigs, and environmental features. You could add more dynamic pieces like swinging ropes or sand dripping out of a vial.</li>
<li>Publish global leaderboards with incentives like badges and special skins, additional content.</li>
<li>Create a YouTube channel for Angry Birds. Did you know there are televised Starcraft games? It&rsquo;s a big deal. Show live footage of pros encountering new levels. Does the top player meticulously size up the level or just run and gun? These videos can help frustrated players get over the hump and defeat some levels.</li>
<li>Spin up forums and discussions for each level. Beyond text, I would allow (encourage) videos showing different strategies.</li>
<li>Look at scoring based on speed and precision: extreme Angry Birds.</li>
<li>Expand into multiplayer capabilities.</li>
<li>Keep rocking! I&rsquo;ve seen Angry Birds in commercials for pistachios and a phone, plus there are plush toys. Great marketing!</li>
</ul>


<p>Would you enjoy any of these features? What would you do if you managed Angry Birds?</p>

      <p>In JavaScript, if on a non-boolean input will check existence. In Ruby, the same test will also check for existence with &ldquo;&rdquo; considered true; you receive a warning (warning: string literal in condition). Python performs like JavaScript. In Java, you receive a type error (Type mismatch: cannot convert from String to boolean). I show the output from JavaScript console, irb, python, and Java.</p>

<p>JavaScript</p>

<pre>&gt; if ("false") { console.log("true"); } else { console.log("false"); }
true</pre>


<pre>&gt; if ("") { console.log("true"); } else { console.log("false"); }
false</pre>


<p>Ruby</p>

<pre>puts "false" ? "true" : "false"
(irb):4: warning: string literal in condition
true</pre>


<pre>&gt; puts "" ? "true" : "false"
(irb):1: warning: string literal in condition
true</pre>


<p>Python</p>

<pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; if ("false"):
...     print "true"
... else:
...     print "false"
...
true</pre>


<pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; if (""):
...     print "true"
... else:
...     print "false"
...
false</pre>


<p>Java</p>

<pre>if ("false") {
    System.out.println("true");
} else {
    System.out.println("false");
}

Exception in thread "main" java.lang.Error: Unresolved compilation problem:
Type mismatch: cannot convert from String to boolean</pre>


<p>No matter how the language handles it, it&rsquo;s bad coding style because of erratic behavior. Save the next programmer some grief and specify the full expression whose truthiness you are seeking.</p>

<hr />

<p>JavaScript is not multi-threaded; the spec does not specify any threading or synchronization. JavaScript in modern browsers is single-threaded. Handling multiple actions at once is done by firing off functions and waiting for callbacks.</p>

<hr />

<p>In Java, the default equals method will compare the memory location of two objects; the default hashcode implementation will return the memory address.</p>

<hr />

<p>In Java, all data structures in Collections offer a method, size(), to access the data structure&rsquo;s size. Primitive arrays have a property, length (note the difference in name and method vs property). Strings use a method, length(), to make things more confusing!</p>

<pre>List&lt;Integer&gt; list = new ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt;();
System.out.println(list.size());
0</pre>


<pre>int array[] = new int[10];
System.out.println(array.length);
10</pre>


<pre>String string = new String();
System.out.println(string.length());
0</pre>


<hr />

<p>One way to implement a fixed-size cache is to store elements twice: one in a hash map and one in a linked list. To add an element, first check size; if you&rsquo;re at capacity, remove the oldest element (the head of the linked list) from both structures, then insert the element into both data structures (at the end of the linked list and at the proper location in the hash map). This can be done in constant time. The contains() method is a simple hash map look-up in constant time. This data structure optimizes overall run time [O(n)] at the cost of storing elements twice.</p>

      <p>A friend of mine mentioned that he didn&rsquo;t like Gmail&rsquo;s built-in tasks, which prompted me to share a couple Chrome extensions (they exist for Firefox too) that I have come to enjoy. Here they</p>

<ul>
<li><a title="TaskForce to-do list in Gmail" href="https://www.taskforceapp.com/">TaskForce</a> - a task list that&rsquo;s a little better than Google&rsquo;s default</li>

<li><a title="Klout for Rapportive" href="http://kloutlet.com/">Klout raplet</a> - adds the recipient&rsquo;s Klout score at the bottom of the Rapportive sidebar. (Klout is a way of measuring a person&rsquo;s influence on Twitter.)</li>

      <p>There are myriad ways to optimize a program, but you can go a long way with three rhyming concepts:</p>

<p><a title="Wikipedia: Cache" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache">cache</a> -  Perform operations once then store them; you trade memory for speed and reduced access to database (for example).</p>

<p><a title="Wikipedia: Hash table" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table">hash</a> -  Hash maps are fast and efficient for a lot of algorithms; for example, a trie (suffix tree) is faster when implemented as a hash map than as a tree (because insertions and lookup are constant time on average with a hash map but log(n) for trees).</p>

<p><a title="Wikipedia: Thrashing" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrashing_(computer_science)">thrash</a> -  Avoid competing for resources, as in database or hard drive lookups.</p>

<p>I thought cache, hash, and thrash was a neat mnemonic. Do you have another go-to for optimizations? Know any other neat mnemonics?</p>

      <p>I received a lot of great feedback after <a title="Seth Holloway: Asking for feedback on summer 2011 resume" href="http://sethholloway.com/blog/2011/09/08/summer-2011-resume/">putting my resume online and asking for help</a>. Thanks for the help everyone! As <a title="NPR: Kevin Kelly reads his essay" href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=18463814">Kevin Kelly might say</a>, &ldquo;the universe is conspiring to help us.&rdquo; Below I outline what I did and why.</p>

<ul>
<li>Name: no PhD&ndash;just Seth Michael Holloway. Since the PhD is not needed for the job, the consensus was that the suffix would do more harm than good.</li>
<li>Retooled the summary to combine summary and objective. At first I removed the sections altogether because I thought it was wasted space that can hurt more than it can help. A friend convinced me that this one section grabs the reader&rsquo;s attention and draws them in. Now that you have their attention, do something good with it, like tell them your relevant skills!</li>
<li>I put the skills section below the new summary and broke skills into &ldquo;technologies&rdquo; and &ldquo;general&rdquo; subsections. A skills section allow busy people to determine my experience without having to read everything below. If the reader is interested in my skills after reading the summary, I&rsquo;m doing well.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m a recent grad so education stays up top and comes next. &ldquo;So Seth&rsquo;s summary matches our desired candidate as do his skills; he&rsquo;s educated&hellip; where has he worked?&rdquo; And that leads to work experience.</li>
<li>I cleaned up bullet points and job experience as the resume constantly evolves!</li>
<li>One big change in the experience section is the inclusion of &ldquo;intern&rdquo; in titles held during school. College kids are expected to have internship experience, so admitting a job was an internship does not hurt. These positions show that I balanced work and school. I had a hard time deciding on my most recent IBM job because I ended up owning a decent sized project that was important to several teams worldwide&ndash;hardly your standard internship! I felt like a part-timer, but intern is more self-explanatory.</li>
<li>Everyone said to shorten, so I removed a couple jobs and moved the interesting bits into the skills and clubs sections. The awards and honors section is out.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve left publications because they don&rsquo;t make a difference in length right now (over 2 pages with or without). Those publications show that I&rsquo;m well on my way to my 10,000 hours of writing (Gladwell&rsquo;s assertion that expertise takes 10,000 hours), and I&rsquo;m proud of the quality. I need to work on a blog post or alternate resume that shows the number of hours I&rsquo;ve put into various fields&hellip;</li>
<li>That&rsquo;s about it. The resume spills onto three pages, and I&rsquo;m okay with that for now. I have something between a CV and a resume! I figure that later sections are just a cookie for anyone dedicated enough to read that far :) One day I&rsquo;ll get down to 1 or 2 pages&hellip;</li>
</ul>


<div>I hope my thought process makes sense and that people like the <a title="Seth Holloway's awesome resume" href="http://sethholloway.com/resume.html">resume</a>. I really appreciate the help and know that I&#8217;ll find a great job as a result. If you have any other suggestions or see a flaw in my logic, please let me know.</div>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/advertising-on-linkedin-sucks/">Advertising on LinkedIn (Sucks)</a></h1>
      <p>As part of creating a business page for <a title="Oilfield Intel: oil and gas service and equipment reviews" href="http://oilfieldintelligence.com">Oilfield Intelligence</a> (a niche review site for oil and gas services and equipment), LinkedIn kindly provided $50 worth of credit for their ads. That was enough to entice me, so I set up the ads. Four pages: create your ads, choose your target audience, select pay for impressions or clicks, and input payment information.</p>

<p>At first I chose to pay per click (CPC), but they were charging close to $5.00 per. Ouch! We do not have metrics for how much a single visitor is worth, but I suspect it is much less than $5.00 each and that&rsquo;s if we had 100% conversion rate. Normal consumer web apps run around 1% conversion rate, so you&rsquo;d need 100 people on your page before one signed up. At $5.00 per person, that&rsquo;s $500 per new account. Yikes! Unfortunately, by the time I had done the math and researched a bit more, my LinkedIn session had expired (really? log me out in a few minutes?).</p>

<p>So, I return to the page and recreate the ads, choose who I want to target, choose PPC, and hit next. It&rsquo;s a payment form, and I owe them $5 for setting up my account! At this point I&rsquo;m feeling like I got the bait-and-switch: $50 &ldquo;free advertising&rdquo; for a $5 sign-up is a good deal, but it felt shady. I&rsquo;m looking to see where I can set the limit on ad spending so I don&rsquo;t have to pay anything out-of-pocket (it&rsquo;s only an experiment, so I don&rsquo;t want to shell out a lot of money before I can at least make a weak approximation at its value); there&rsquo;s nothing you can do to limit your spending, except set the limit per day and the number of days to run. Again, this feels rather shady since the minimum per day is $10 so they&rsquo;ll have me for $10 everyday that I forget to turn the advertising off. Ugh. &ldquo;Fine,&rdquo; I think, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go back and cap it at $10 per day for 5 days.&rdquo; The payment form has virtually no navigation. You can go forward (submit your information) or return to LinkedIn, but not back to the previous three pages. I press my back button and see the familiar &lsquo;resubmit form&rsquo; dialog. I click to resubmit and I&rsquo;m routed to the homepage&hellip;</p>

<p>A third time, I begin the ads process because nothing has been saved. I re-create the ads, re-target the ads, then adjust the costs and move on to payment information. Apparently something had been saved! After several minutes of duplicated effort, I find that I have already set-up my account and they just need my payment information. I&rsquo;m not sure why they could not tell me that on the first three pages.</p>

<p>This morning, I log in and check the report:</p>

<div>

<img class="size-medium wp-image-1479" title="OI-LinkedIn-Ad-Metrics" src="/images/OI-LinkedIn-Ads-300x30.png" alt="OI LinkedIn Ad Metrics" width="300" height="30" />

</div>


<p>They had served the ad almost 6,000 times! And of those 6,000 impressions, we received two clicks. LinkedIn estimates those clicks to be worth $6.16! Good thing I am only paying for impressions&hellip; I am paying for impressions, right? That screenshot says I&rsquo;ve spent $12.32. Checking the billing, I see this:</p>

<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-1480" title="OI-LinkedIn-Ad-Costs" src="/images/OI-LinkedIn-Ad-Costs-300x28.png" alt="OI LinkedIn Ad Costs" width="300" height="28" /></p>

<p>The image shows that I had spent $2.57, a number that I am baffled by. The other page says I&rsquo;ve spent $12.32 based on two clicks worth $6.16 each. $2.57 is closer to the cost per 1,000 impressions, but I never chose that budget. In one pass through the ad setup I agreed to pay around $3.50 per click (not $6.16); on another I agreed to pay $2.00 per 1,000 impressions (the lowest you can go); and on another pass it was $2.50 per 1,000 impressions. Never $2.57. Weird.</p>

<p>My initial impressions? Advertising on LinkedIn sucks. The site feels like an alpha release (as in not even ready for beta, much less a full product). The UI and information sharing is awful (how much have I actually spent and where did that number come from?). The setup is confusing. The navigation is weak. Perhaps worst of all, the ad placement is &ldquo;unobtrusive&rdquo; to put it nicely; more bluntly, the UI is cluttered and I cannot find the ads I&rsquo;m paying above market rates for. I plan to use up the $50 credit then abandon the platform until substantial upgrades are made.</p>

<p>Compared to Google: Google offered $100 worth of AdWords credit&ndash;twice what LinkedIn is willing to part with. My Google ads are costing $0.39 per click&ndash;over ten times less expensive than LinkedIn! Google&rsquo;s setup and reporting are markedly better.</p>

<p>Compared to Facebook: the <a title="Oilfield Intelligence on Facebook" href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Oilfield-Intelligence/256146977729169">OI Facebook page</a> seems to be ranked way higher than the <a title="Oilfield Intelligence official page on LinkedIn" href="http://www.linkedin.com/company/oilfield-intelligence">OI LinkedIn page</a>. I interpret that to mean that the Facebook page is a better use of our time than LinkedIn in general. Reading about ads, both LinkedIn and Facebook offer an abysmal 0.1% click-through-rate, so the cost per 1,000 impressions is usually equal to the cost per click.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll admit I&rsquo;m new to setting up CPC campaigns, but LinkedIn just seems bad. Am I missing something?</p>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/cmo-initiatives/">CMO Initiatives</a></h1>
      <p>A few days ago I wrote about the <a title="Seth Holloway: Chief Morale Officer (CMO)" href="http://sethholloway.com/blog/2011/08/22/cmo-chief-morale-officer/">Chief Morale Officer</a>, an important role that I think more companies should fill. The previous post is a bit high level, so I thought I&rsquo;d be more concrete and enumerate a few ideas on how to improve morale.</p>

<ul>
<li>At the core, I&rsquo;d say companies need to respect and empower employees. Focus on happiness with a focus on each employee achieving mastery, autonomy, and purpose.</li>
<li>Our <a title="Wikipedia: Dunbar's Number" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar's_number">primate brains can only handle between 100 and 230 connections</a>, so units and teams should be built with this in mind. Recent experiments have shown that compassion and respect are inverse with the gap in pay and humanity (tall organizational structures with tons of people in between top and bottom).</li>
<li><p>Trying to handle real-life matters is stressful when you&rsquo;re stuck at work during normal business hours; for example, when are you going to get your car fixed? The mechanic is open from 6am-6pm and you need your car to get to work, so before work is really inconvenient; if you&rsquo;re at work until 5pm then you won&rsquo;t get to the mechanic until 5:30pm and then you&rsquo;re competing with everyone else in the same situation. You&rsquo;re unlikely to get your car back before the next day, but wait! you need your car to get to work&hellip; A few ideas to alleviate stress from similar situations:</p>

<ul>
<li>four day work weeks (work 40 hours in 4 days then take the 5th day off) or 9/80 (work 80 hours in 9 days then take the 10th day off)</li>
<li>flexible start and end times</li>
<li>the ability to telecommute (at least once a week)</li>
<li>half-day hump day (9 hours Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday and 4 hours on Wednesday). Kids love half days a school; I think big kids would enjoy it too.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Some people never take a day off and others take more than their allotment, but I think the American average is to err on the side of caution and work.  It is difficult to take vacation when there is a deadline looming. Everyone else is still working, so people often feel they cannot, in good conscience, take vacation. To combat this, I would shut the company down a couple weeks a year: early summer and late December. This would give the employee two solid weeks off and ease their mind because it is officially okay to enjoy yourself.</p></li>
<li>Employees should personally continue to improve their skills and stay abreast of market trends, but companies can help too. A little consistent training over many years leads to an exponentially more knowledgeable employee. This is also a huge perk! Companies can say, &ldquo;Come to our company and continue to grow and learn! You will not be bored.&rdquo; Something as simple as a weekly lunch and learn could help employees stay productive while still learning new things. Another approach to learning new things is short stints in a different role. Adult internships are becoming more common, and I think companies should internalize that by allowing employees to check out a different area for a period (perhaps in blocks ranging from 4 hours to 1 work-week). Exploring other teams and other functions is very healthy. Seeing how others work and what they do has numerous benefits like: (1) diffusing knowledge allowing observer and observee to learn and teach, (2) mitigating risk that only one person knows how to perform any action, and (3) increasing empathy.</li>
<li>Empower employees to make the decisions they need. How many times have you had to wait while a surly, unhappy employee retrieves the manager? That&rsquo;s not a fun position for the customer or the employee. A toy example: the doorman can be President of Greeting who is personally responsible for making everyone smile. He/she could access to coupons, vouchers, umbrellas, etc and be able to talk to managers who could benefit from his/her observations.</li>
<li>Encourage people to maintain clean, personalized spaces. <a title="Fog Creek Blog: Price of Developer Happiness" href="http://blog.fogcreek.com/the-price-of-dev-happiness-part-one/">At the high end a fully appointed developer setup is $6,174</a>. Businesses are nothing without employees and the <a title="CNN: Revenue per Employee" href="http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune500/2007/performers/industries/revenues_per_employee/index.html">revenue per employee can be thousands or more per year</a>, so providing a clean, comfortable working area is a small investment with a huge ROI. If you&rsquo;re running lean, allowing people to bring in materials and make their cube more hospitable costs you nothing but can improve morale and productivity.</li>
<li>Operate with transparency and openness, flatten the structures and allow people to communicate across levels. I think this is where a CMO would have real power&ndash;they could act as a bridge between management and employees. Everyone wants respect. They want to be heard. Stories from some successful companies mention that the CEO spends a few minutes per day talking to random employees. People love these CEOs and it keeps the CEO in touch with the pulse of the people. How empowering for both sides. Awesome!</li>
</ul>

<p>Well, I think that&rsquo;s enough for now! There are more ideas, lots of literature to read, and experiments to be done! I leave you with a <a title="TED: Shawn Achor" href="http://tedxtalks.ted.com/video/TEDxBloomington-Shawn-Achor-The">great video on positive psychology</a> (If it doesn&rsquo;t play above, the video is a TED talk by Shawn Achor).</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s your best idea for how to improve your own morale? What about a sweeping change to help all employees&#8217; morale?</p>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/black-out-glass-a-way-to-keep-cars-cool-and-more/">Reflective glass: a way to keep cars cool&#8230; and more</a></h1>
      <p>I have several ideas of how we could improve cars and driving; I imagine the subject is pretty common because we&rsquo;re surrounded by and rely so heavily on vehicles. I previously talked about<a title="Seth Holloway: Confiurable UI in cars" href="http://sethholloway.com/blog/2011/01/14/idea-configurable-user-interfaces-in-cars/"> improving cars usability by allowing users to configure their displays and controls</a>. With the recent heat wave I can&rsquo;t help but think of ways to help keep cars cool. A lot of us use car shades to block a bit of the sun, but we could do better in terms of efficiency and ease-of-use. The idea I keep coming to: cars could automatically black-out the glass when the car is off. (The technology exists and is called <a title="Wikipedia: Smart Glass" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_glass">smart glass</a>.)</p>

<p>Having heavily tinted windows would keep the car cooler, but the benefits don&rsquo;t stop there! This would also provide security because people would not be able to see your valuables. Smart glass would also greatly increase privacy as no one could see if you&rsquo;re in the car changing clothes, shaving, taking a nap, etc.</p>

<p>I do not know of any cars that apply the technology, but I saw the idea &ldquo;implemented&rdquo; in the vampire movie Daybreakers. The trailer quickly shows how the <a title="YouTube: Daybreakers Trailer" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8yYNDygdZs&amp;t=64">vampire can black out the windows in his car around 1:04 in</a>. Have you seen the concept anywhere else?</p>

<p>What would this feature be worth to you? I think I&rsquo;d be comfortable paying another thousand dollars for a car using smart glass that would stay cooler in the summer, provided added security and allow more privacy. What do you think?</p>

<p><em>Update</em>: Steve pointed out the physics fail of having black windows (black would absorb the heat and the glass would trap it inside the heat, making the effect even worse). The idea of dynamically changing the glass to reduce heat stays the same, but we would want a reflective surface rather than a dark surface. And while I&rsquo;m making updates based on physics, let&rsquo;s put a one-way release valve near the top of the car so that convection can push warm air out of the vehicle!</p>
