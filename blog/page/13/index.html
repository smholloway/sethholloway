      <p>I have several ideas of how we could improve cars and driving; I imagine the subject is pretty common because we&rsquo;re surrounded by and rely so heavily on vehicles. I previously talked about<a title="Seth Holloway: Confiurable UI in cars" href="http://sethholloway.com/blog/2011/01/14/idea-configurable-user-interfaces-in-cars/"> improving cars usability by allowing users to configure their displays and controls</a>. With the recent heat wave I can&rsquo;t help but think of ways to help keep cars cool. A lot of us use car shades to block a bit of the sun, but we could do better in terms of efficiency and ease-of-use. The idea I keep coming to: cars could automatically black-out the glass when the car is off. (The technology exists and is called <a title="Wikipedia: Smart Glass" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_glass">smart glass</a>.)</p>

<p>Having heavily tinted windows would keep the car cooler, but the benefits don&rsquo;t stop there! This would also provide security because people would not be able to see your valuables. Smart glass would also greatly increase privacy as no one could see if you&rsquo;re in the car changing clothes, shaving, taking a nap, etc.</p>

<p>I do not know of any cars that apply the technology, but I saw the idea &ldquo;implemented&rdquo; in the vampire movie Daybreakers. The trailer quickly shows how the <a title="YouTube: Daybreakers Trailer" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8yYNDygdZs&amp;t=64">vampire can black out the windows in his car around 1:04 in</a>. Have you seen the concept anywhere else?</p>

<p>What would this feature be worth to you? I think I&rsquo;d be comfortable paying another thousand dollars for a car using smart glass that would stay cooler in the summer, provided added security and allow more privacy. What do you think?</p>

<p><em>Update</em>: Steve pointed out the physics fail of having black windows (black would absorb the heat and the glass would trap it inside the heat, making the effect even worse). The idea of dynamically changing the glass to reduce heat stays the same, but we would want a reflective surface rather than a dark surface. And while I&rsquo;m making updates based on physics, let&rsquo;s put a one-way release valve near the top of the car so that convection can push warm air out of the vehicle!</p>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/food-trucks-are-restaurants-version-of-a-lean-startup/">Food trucks are restaurant&#8217;s version of a lean startup</a></h1>
      <p>Austin is boomtown for food trucks. They&rsquo;re everywhere! For example, the trailer-food park on South 1st (<a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/south-austin-trailer-park-and-eatery-austin">http://www.yelp.com/biz/south-austin-trailer-park-and-eatery-austin</a>). There are too many great food trucks around town to name, but a couple of my favorites are Sushi-A-Go-Go and Gourdough&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>Anyway, after a recent outing where I sat at a kitschy picnic table in the summer heat eating trailer food, it struck me that food trucks are restaurant&rsquo;s version of a lean startup. Just as the cost of starting a software business went down with the commoditization of hardware and bandwidth, we&rsquo;re seeing an explosion of restaurants thanks to greatly reduced startup and operation expenses offered by trucks/trailers/carts. I imagine that by using a truck/trailer/cart, the business owner saves a ton of money; I&rsquo;d guess there are significant savings on electricity (heating and cooling, lighting), service (less area to maintain, fewer waiters necessary), and rent. How cool is that?!</p>

<p>The truck/cart/stand is the proving ground. Those who are happy with their situation are free to keep doing what they&rsquo;re doing, or they can move easily (thanks to the mobility of the restaurant). Business owners who choose to expand can move to a more permanent home in a brick-and-mortar store. A few Austin examples include Franklin&rsquo;s BBQ, Man Bites Dog, and Torchy&rsquo;s Tacos.</p>

<p>Overall, I think it&rsquo;s a great trend! As the options increase, food quality goes up and prices go down. And don&rsquo;t tell anyone, but I have a little dream of opening Austin&rsquo;s first decent ramen restaurant&hellip;</p>

<p>What do you think? Do you like the trend? Does my analogy make sense? What food trucks/trailers/carts do you like? What are we missing?</p>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/cmo-chief-morale-officer/">CMO - Chief Morale Officer</a></h1>
      <p>Companies should create a Chief Morale Officer (CMO) whose sole job is to improve the situation for the company&rsquo;s employees. I believe that morale is equally important as other C-level positions (accounting/finance, strategy/vision, or technology) so it should be treated with similar respect.</p>

<p><a title="Wikipedia: Knowledge Worker Productivity" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_work_productivity" target="_blank">Knowledge worker productivity</a> is very important. We&rsquo;re seeing renewed interest in the area and a few neat studies, such as this one using <a title="Arxiv MT and productivity" href="http://www.technologyreview.com/blog/arxiv/25636/">Mechanical Turk</a>. Dan Pink gave a <a title="TED: Dan Pink on Motivation" href="http://www.ted.com/talks/dan_pink_on_motivation.html" target="_blank">great TED talk</a> on the subject in which he declares that workers need three things: mastery, autonomy, and purpose. I firmly believe that morale is the X-factor that leads to continuing success for companies.</p>

<p>Google and Apple have employees that are proud, motivated, and happy. And these people continue to produce amazing products. Many acquisitions are done in hopes of gaining the best and brightest people, but as soon as these people join the new company, their morale drops and their ideas dry up. A happy worker is a productive worker; they bring ideas, energy, enthusiasm, care and concern. An unhappy programmer may hammer out 100 lines of undocumented, uncreative code a day, while a happy programmer would write 200 lines of well documented, elegant code with tests. Being happy removes distractions and helps you find your flow.</p>

<p>As we move more and more towards a service economy, many jobs cannot be done by unhappy people. Happy people are better at service. <a title="Alain de Botton on the Pleasures and Sorrows of Work" href="http://www.econtalk.org/archives/2010/09/de_botton_on_th.html">Humans can be thought of as complex machines</a>. If you&rsquo;re going to acquire a complex machine, take care of it. You should not break your complex tools or your business fails. Overall, businesses should be getting nicer, although I&rsquo;m not sure that&rsquo;s true.</p>

<p>Companies should create a Chief Morale Officer (CMO) whose sole job is to improve the situation for the company&rsquo;s employees. Make work fun and reap the rewards!</p>

      <p><strong>Note: I started writing this post and it got long, really fast. I&rsquo;m going to publish what I have and worry about tuning it up later&hellip;</strong></p>

<p>I believe that everyone can and should learn how to make a simple, static website. There are billions of websites and our lives increasingly involve the web (a nice side effect: there are a lot of jobs in the area). What do you need to begin? A text editor and a web browser. Now you&rsquo;re on your way to creating webpages with HTML/CSS!</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR</strong></p>

<p>Open a text editor, type or copy/paste in &lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;title&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;body&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;, save the file as index.html, fire up a web browser, and open the file. You&rsquo;ve just created a webpage!</p>

<p><strong>Full</strong></p>

<p>HTML &ndash; the structure:</p>

<ul>
<li><a title="Wikipedia - HTML" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">Wikipedia &ndash; HTML</a></li>
<li><a title="W3C - HTML specification" href="http://www.w3.org/html/">W3C &ndash; HTML specification</a></li>
<li><a title="W3C - HTML training" href="http://www.w3.org/wiki/HTML/Training">W3C &ndash; HTML training materials</a></li>
</ul>


<p>CSS &ndash; the style:</p>

<ul>
<li><a title="Wikipedia - CSS" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets">Wikipedia &ndash; CSS</a></li>
<li><a title="W3C - CSS" href="http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/">W3C &ndash; CSS specification</a></li>
<li><a title="W3C - CSS training" href="http://www.w3.org/wiki/CSS/Training">W3C &ndash; CSS training materials</a></li>
</ul>


<p>Text editors: (NOTE: a platform is another way of saying operating system like Mac OS X, Windows XP/Vista/7, etc)</p>

<ul>
<li>Notepad (Windows only, built-in, free)</li>
<li>Wordpad (Windows only, built-in to, free)</li>
<li>TextEdit (Mac only, built-in, free)</li>
<li>gedit (Linux only, built-in to Ubuntu, free)</li>
<li><a title="Notepad++" href="http://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a> (all platforms, downloadable, free)</li>
<li><a title="Macromates - TextMate" href="http://macromates.com/">TextMate</a> (Mac only, downloadable, ~$58)</li>
<li><a title="Eclipse" href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a> (all platforms, downloadable, free)</li>
<li><a title="jEdit" href="http://www.jedit.org/">jEdit</a> (Linux only, downloadable, free).</li>
<li>In a pinch, Microsoft Word or another word processor will work, but these are suboptimal.</li>
<li>You could also learn Vim, emacs, nano, pico, or a number of others, but I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re as user-friendly&mdash;their power comes from features that a designer probably won&rsquo;t need.</li>
</ul>


<p>Web browsers:</p>

<ul>
<li><a title="Google Chrome" href="http://www.google.com/chrome/">Google Chrome</a> (all platforms, downloadable, free) &ndash; my favorite for speed and built-in tools</li>
<li><a title="Mozilla Firefox" href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/new/">Mozilla Firefox</a> (all platforms, downloadable, free) &ndash; my favorite for extensibility</li>
<li><a title="Apple Safari" href="http://www.apple.com/safari/">Apple Safari</a> (Mac/Windows, built-in/downloadable, free)</li>
<li>Microsoft Internet Explorer (Windows only, built-in, free) &ndash; the most popular browser on the web</li>
<li>There are other web browsers, but they do not have significant market share.</li>
</ul>


<p>I would recommend you start with a concrete task, like creating an &ldquo;About me&rdquo; page that explains who you are and what you&rsquo;re doing. Here&rsquo;s a simple HTML program that you can copy and paste into your text editor, save as index.html, and open in a web browser.</p>

<pre>&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;
      Title
    &lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    Body
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</pre>


<p>Now, extend your simple page. Here are a few recommended tasks:</p>

<ul>
<li>use a new HTML element like a section heading (&lt;h1&gt;&hellip;&lt;/h1&gt;), a link (&lt;a href=&ldquo;&rdquo;&gt;&hellip;&lt;/a&gt;), or a paragraph (&lt;p&gt;&hellip;&lt;/p&gt;)</li>
<li>create and link to an external style file</li>
<li>change the font</li>
<li>change the font color</li>
<li>add an image</li>
<li>change the background color</li>
<li>create a content box that is centered on the page (hint: set width and margins)</li>
</ul>


<p>From here, the sky is the limit! You can create HTML emails, partner with those who do not know how (or are too busy) to make websites, improve the usability of sites for anyone who will let you (for example, non-profits and local favorites).</p>

<p>Anytime you see a webpage you like, simply right click on the background and view the source. The Safari and Chrome inspectors are particularly nice for seeing how the markup and style are interacting.</p>

<p>More advanced topics include SEO, creating your own graphics, further reading, and JavaScript. I&rsquo;ll provide a few links about each below.</p>

<p>HTML/CSS advanced topics:</p>

<ul>
<li>Pseudo elements</li>
<li>Selectors</li>
<li>CSS3 animations, transitions</li>
<li>HTML5 controls like audio and video</li>
</ul>


<p>JavaScript</p>

<ul>
<li>JavaScript</li>
<li>Choose a framework like jQuery, Dojo, or ExtJS</li>
</ul>


<p>Search engine optimization (SEO) &ndash; where your page appears on Google (and other search engines) is tied to your content as well how you structure and style it. Knowing the basics of SEO will let you create pages that will appear higher in search engine results.</p>

<ul>
<li><a title="Wikipedia: Search Engine Optimization" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization">Wikipedia &ndash; SEO</a> &ndash; high-level overview</li>
<li><a title="Google SEO starter guide" href="http://www.google.com/webmasters/docs/search-engine-optimization-starter-guide.pdf">Google Search Engine Optimization Starter Guide</a> &ndash; the search engine to get ranked</li>
<li><a title="SEOmoz beginners guide to SEO" href="http://www.seomoz.org/beginners-guide-to-seo">SEOmoz beginners guide</a> &ndash; another great introductory read</li>
<li><a title="Alexa" href="http://www.alexa.com/">Alexa</a> &ndash; see traffic amounts and webpage information</li>
</ul>


<p>Accessibility &ndash; related to SEO is accessibility. If you create your markup properly, your content will be &ldquo;readable&rdquo; by people with disabilities. Luckily, Google reads your site very similar to the tools utilized by people with disabilities, so making your site more accessible means your site will rank higher on search engines.</p>

<p>Use free UI packs</p>

<p>Create your own graphics &ndash;</p>

<ul>
<li>Adobe Photoshop and Photoshop Express</li>
<li>Adobe Illustrator</li>
<li>GIMP</li>
<li>Inkscape</li>
<li>Pixelmator</li>
<li>Microsoft PowerPoint</li>
<li>Microsoft Paint</li>
<li>Apple Preview</li>
</ul>


<p>Tools and resources</p>

<ul>
<li><a title="Stack Overflow" href="http://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a></li>
<li>Firefox addon &ndash; Firebug</li>

      <p>After hundreds of hours of development, I&rsquo;m ready to share more of my entrepreneurial efforts.</p>

<p><a href="http://oilfieldintelligence.com/">Oilfield Intelligence, a review site for oil and gas service companies</a>, is now in beta! A few friends in the oilfield have helped me define the functionality and I believe it is worthwhile. The dream is to be the Yelp of oil and gas :)</p>

<p>Try it and provide us feedback so we can keep improving the look and functionality. If you know anyone in the oil and gas industry, please share the site with them!</p>

      <p>I love Google Reader! I love the format for finding, reading, and sharing news. I also enjoy Google+, but I find that I&rsquo;d like to discuss Google Reader items more on Google+. Until now, I could not find a way to do so. Frustrated, I decided I&rsquo;d either find a way or write the extension myself. <a title="Share Google Reader items on Google+" href="http://davidvielmetter.com/tricks/share-google-reader-items-on-google-plus/">David Vielmetter has one solution</a>, and you could probably grab the RSS feed of your shared items then push it to Google+, but that would be a series of hacks. I&rsquo;m currently testing the <a title="RSS Share for Google Plus and Google Reader" href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cngpndgifehgejmkemnmmiknpafnhpec#">RSS Share for Google Plus™ and Google Reader™</a> extension for Chrome, and I think it will do the trick.</p>

<p>Has anyone else figured out a better way?</p>

      <p>Humans have an innate need to communicate. We want to connect and bond and form tribes where we are comfortable. Today, there are more tools than ever to codify the ties that bind and services to let you connect with people you&rsquo;ve never met. Yet these services pile on features and gain users without truly defining how they should be used.</p>

<p>For each of the popular services there&rsquo;s at least one clone like Diaspora:Facebook, Bing:Google, Codeplane:GitHub. For each individual function provided by the large services, there&rsquo;s a single-purpose service; for example, Yelp rivals Google Places and Songkick competes with Facebook Events for concerts. I&rsquo;m left wondering, where is the line between email, Twitter, Facebook, Google+, Google Reader, Google Buzz, GitHub, LinkedIn, Tumblr, individual blogs, etc?</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s take an example of wanting to &ldquo;connect&rdquo; with your favorite programmer that you don&rsquo;t personally know. Facebook and LinkedIn are (or arguably should be) out. You can follow your favorite programmer on Twitter, but GitHub seems more appropriate. Now we have Google+ that sits somewhere between Facebook and Twitter, so you could find your favorite there as well. So which do you choose?</p>

<p>Taking another example of a band: MySpace may very well be the best way to connect with them. However, they will probably have Facebook and Twitter accounts as well as a personal site, and quite possibly, a personal blog. Do you follow their blog posts by periodically visiting the site or do you receive updates effortlessly using RSS? Are the posts replicated on Facebook or MySpace? Are the posts teased with tweets?</p>

<p>There are many more examples like brands (I should visit facebook.com/downy instead of their full site???), celebrities, government officials, etc.</p>

<p>So, where is the line between these services? How do you use the many different social services? Does it annoy you when companies &ldquo;misuse&rdquo; the services?</p>

      <p>I recently increased my activity on Twitter (meaning I started following a lot of people). After my flurry of activity I noticed something strange: for roughly every 10 people I followed, I had about 1 person follow me. Notice I did not say &ldquo;follow me back.&rdquo; In my case, these were some kind of bots that randomly follow people. I checked and they did not have people in common so it&rsquo;s not like they just follow everyone that Guy Kawasaki follows, but there&rsquo;s a definite spike in following based on twitter activity.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a crudely formatted profile from one of the spammers:</p>

<p>Whenever you navigate to Loren&rsquo;s profile page, you see a link to an adult site. I&rsquo;m baffled by the whole situation. Some questions keeping me up at night:</p>

<p><em>What is the ROI on an outfit like this?</em> Sure, you can automate virtually everything and you can mechanical turk out captcha solving and account creation for pennies, but do you gain anything from a twitter bot that randomly follows people (and nothing else)?</p>

<p><em>What is the purpose of following people?</em> It seems they simply want to drive traffic, but in the example above only 516 people would have seen the site. As I understand it, you won&rsquo;t gain any search engine cred beyond the twitter backlink (some think that retweets&mdash;abbreviated RT&mdash;might convey some power), and the bot&rsquo;s <a title="Klout for the twitter bot" href="http://klout.com/#/lorendisorda710">Klout score is insignificant</a> at 0-1 so they have virtually no influence.</p>

<p><em>Who would a real person follow these spammers back?</em> With 0 tweets the bots are simply not adding any value, so why would you want to connect with them? If you google for twitter users who follow back, you&rsquo;ll find a lot of people willing to trade follows. The most ridiculous I saw was a guy claiming that he would win a car if he could get enough followers. If you simply want to game the system and appear larger than life, this is one way to do it I guess&hellip; I&rsquo;d guess a lot of the people following the bots are bots themselves.</p>

<p><em>Why not automate tweeting too?</em> The programmers clearly have the Twitter API down, so why not pause for a random number of seconds then tweet something like, &ldquo;&lt;site name&gt; is &lt;adjective to draw people in&gt;&rdquo; and repeat. Even 1000 nearly identical tweets would look more reputable than 0.</p>

<p><em>How many accounts have been banned for the bot masters to fine-tune this process?</em> I suspect that following too many people at once would trigger a bot alarm and get your account banned; perhaps automated tweeting can be detected and squashed too. Given the amount of utter garbage being generated in bite-sized chunks, I don&rsquo;t think they have a filter in place :)</p>

<p><em>Capitalization and punctuation, really?</em> I must admit that I have a better impression of this twitter bot than I did of some previous ones that with descriptions that were hardly English. Again, I imagine this is a data driven decision so I would love to know how many accounts they tried with broken English/poor grammar and punctuation. Did foreigners and young people relate more to the informal style?</p>

<p><em>Who is behind twitter bots?</em> Is this all the work of HBGary and their persona management system under development when they were hacked by Anonymous? Probably not! I suspect the people in charge are not that sophisticated, although their motives are unclear to me.</p>

<p><em>How are the names chosen?</em> I figured the names were random, but then I dug a bit deeper. Interestingly enough, <a title="Klout for lorendisorda70" href="http://klout.com/#/lorendisorda70">@lorendisorda70 is a fairly popular person</a> so the @lorendisorda710 handle may be a ploy to attract typo prone or easily confused users.</p>

<p>Anyone have any thoughts?</p>

      <p>I&rsquo;m looking for the best way to determine a statistical model. I have a lot of data that comprises some (not all) variables and the associated outputs. Now, I would like to solve for the weights for the variables.</p>

<p>In the past I used Excel as well as a now defunct super spreadsheet application.  <a title="Weka from the University of Waikato" href="http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/">Weka</a> was recommended, but I&rsquo;m curious what other options exist. Is there a software package that will run different regressions, ultimately provided the best fit model?</p>

<p>Any help will be appreciated!</p>
