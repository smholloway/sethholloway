      <p><strong>Note: I started writing this post and it got long, really fast. I&rsquo;m going to publish what I have and worry about tuning it up later&hellip;</strong></p>

<p>I believe that everyone can and should learn how to make a simple, static website. There are billions of websites and our lives increasingly involve the web (a nice side effect: there are a lot of jobs in the area). What do you need to begin? A text editor and a web browser. Now you&rsquo;re on your way to creating webpages with HTML/CSS!</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR</strong></p>

<p>Open a text editor, type or copy/paste in &lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;title&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;body&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;, save the file as index.html, fire up a web browser, and open the file. You&rsquo;ve just created a webpage!</p>

<p><strong>Full</strong></p>

<p>HTML &ndash; the structure:</p>

<ul>
<li><a title="Wikipedia - HTML" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">Wikipedia &ndash; HTML</a></li>
<li><a title="W3C - HTML specification" href="http://www.w3.org/html/">W3C &ndash; HTML specification</a></li>
<li><a title="W3C - HTML training" href="http://www.w3.org/wiki/HTML/Training">W3C &ndash; HTML training materials</a></li>
</ul>


<p>CSS &ndash; the style:</p>

<ul>
<li><a title="Wikipedia - CSS" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets">Wikipedia &ndash; CSS</a></li>
<li><a title="W3C - CSS" href="http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/">W3C &ndash; CSS specification</a></li>
<li><a title="W3C - CSS training" href="http://www.w3.org/wiki/CSS/Training">W3C &ndash; CSS training materials</a></li>
</ul>


<p>Text editors: (NOTE: a platform is another way of saying operating system like Mac OS X, Windows XP/Vista/7, etc)</p>

<ul>
<li>Notepad (Windows only, built-in, free)</li>
<li>Wordpad (Windows only, built-in to, free)</li>
<li>TextEdit (Mac only, built-in, free)</li>
<li>gedit (Linux only, built-in to Ubuntu, free)</li>
<li><a title="Notepad++" href="http://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a> (all platforms, downloadable, free)</li>
<li><a title="Macromates - TextMate" href="http://macromates.com/">TextMate</a> (Mac only, downloadable, ~$58)</li>
<li><a title="Eclipse" href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a> (all platforms, downloadable, free)</li>
<li><a title="jEdit" href="http://www.jedit.org/">jEdit</a> (Linux only, downloadable, free).</li>
<li>In a pinch, Microsoft Word or another word processor will work, but these are suboptimal.</li>
<li>You could also learn Vim, emacs, nano, pico, or a number of others, but I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re as user-friendly&mdash;their power comes from features that a designer probably won&rsquo;t need.</li>
</ul>


<p>Web browsers:</p>

<ul>
<li><a title="Google Chrome" href="http://www.google.com/chrome/">Google Chrome</a> (all platforms, downloadable, free) &ndash; my favorite for speed and built-in tools</li>
<li><a title="Mozilla Firefox" href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/new/">Mozilla Firefox</a> (all platforms, downloadable, free) &ndash; my favorite for extensibility</li>
<li><a title="Apple Safari" href="http://www.apple.com/safari/">Apple Safari</a> (Mac/Windows, built-in/downloadable, free)</li>
<li>Microsoft Internet Explorer (Windows only, built-in, free) &ndash; the most popular browser on the web</li>
<li>There are other web browsers, but they do not have significant market share.</li>
</ul>


<p>I would recommend you start with a concrete task, like creating an &ldquo;About me&rdquo; page that explains who you are and what you&rsquo;re doing. Here&rsquo;s a simple HTML program that you can copy and paste into your text editor, save as index.html, and open in a web browser.</p>

<pre>&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;
      Title
    &lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    Body
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</pre>


<p>Now, extend your simple page. Here are a few recommended tasks:</p>

<ul>
<li>use a new HTML element like a section heading (&lt;h1&gt;&hellip;&lt;/h1&gt;), a link (&lt;a href=&ldquo;&rdquo;&gt;&hellip;&lt;/a&gt;), or a paragraph (&lt;p&gt;&hellip;&lt;/p&gt;)</li>
<li>create and link to an external style file</li>
<li>change the font</li>
<li>change the font color</li>
<li>add an image</li>
<li>change the background color</li>
<li>create a content box that is centered on the page (hint: set width and margins)</li>
</ul>


<p>From here, the sky is the limit! You can create HTML emails, partner with those who do not know how (or are too busy) to make websites, improve the usability of sites for anyone who will let you (for example, non-profits and local favorites).</p>

<p>Anytime you see a webpage you like, simply right click on the background and view the source. The Safari and Chrome inspectors are particularly nice for seeing how the markup and style are interacting.</p>

<p>More advanced topics include SEO, creating your own graphics, further reading, and JavaScript. I&rsquo;ll provide a few links about each below.</p>

<p>HTML/CSS advanced topics:</p>

<ul>
<li>Pseudo elements</li>
<li>Selectors</li>
<li>CSS3 animations, transitions</li>
<li>HTML5 controls like audio and video</li>
</ul>


<p>JavaScript</p>

<ul>
<li>JavaScript</li>
<li>Choose a framework like jQuery, Dojo, or ExtJS</li>
</ul>


<p>Search engine optimization (SEO) &ndash; where your page appears on Google (and other search engines) is tied to your content as well how you structure and style it. Knowing the basics of SEO will let you create pages that will appear higher in search engine results.</p>

<ul>
<li><a title="Wikipedia: Search Engine Optimization" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization">Wikipedia &ndash; SEO</a> &ndash; high-level overview</li>
<li><a title="Google SEO starter guide" href="http://www.google.com/webmasters/docs/search-engine-optimization-starter-guide.pdf">Google Search Engine Optimization Starter Guide</a> &ndash; the search engine to get ranked</li>
<li><a title="SEOmoz beginners guide to SEO" href="http://www.seomoz.org/beginners-guide-to-seo">SEOmoz beginners guide</a> &ndash; another great introductory read</li>
<li><a title="Alexa" href="http://www.alexa.com/">Alexa</a> &ndash; see traffic amounts and webpage information</li>
</ul>


<p>Accessibility &ndash; related to SEO is accessibility. If you create your markup properly, your content will be &ldquo;readable&rdquo; by people with disabilities. Luckily, Google reads your site very similar to the tools utilized by people with disabilities, so making your site more accessible means your site will rank higher on search engines.</p>

<p>Use free UI packs</p>

<p>Create your own graphics &ndash;</p>

<ul>
<li>Adobe Photoshop and Photoshop Express</li>
<li>Adobe Illustrator</li>
<li>GIMP</li>
<li>Inkscape</li>
<li>Pixelmator</li>
<li>Microsoft PowerPoint</li>
<li>Microsoft Paint</li>
<li>Apple Preview</li>
</ul>


<p>Tools and resources</p>

<ul>
<li><a title="Stack Overflow" href="http://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a></li>
<li>Firefox addon &ndash; Firebug</li>
</ul>


<p>Version control</p>

<ul>
<li>Git</li>

<li>Dropbox</li>
</ul>

      <p>I love Google Reader! I love the format for finding, reading, and sharing news. I also enjoy Google+, but I find that I&rsquo;d like to discuss Google Reader items more on Google+. Until now, I could not find a way to do so. Frustrated, I decided I&rsquo;d either find a way or write the extension myself. <a title="Share Google Reader items on Google+" href="http://davidvielmetter.com/tricks/share-google-reader-items-on-google-plus/">David Vielmetter has one solution</a>, and you could probably grab the RSS feed of your shared items then push it to Google+, but that would be a series of hacks. I&rsquo;m currently testing the <a title="RSS Share for Google Plus and Google Reader" href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cngpndgifehgejmkemnmmiknpafnhpec#">RSS Share for Google Plus™ and Google Reader™</a> extension for Chrome, and I think it will do the trick.</p>

<p>Has anyone else figured out a better way?</p>

      <p>Humans have an innate need to communicate. We want to connect and bond and form tribes where we are comfortable. Today, there are more tools than ever to codify the ties that bind and services to let you connect with people you&rsquo;ve never met. Yet these services pile on features and gain users without truly defining how they should be used.</p>

<p>For each of the popular services there&rsquo;s at least one clone like Diaspora:Facebook, Bing:Google, Codeplane:GitHub. For each individual function provided by the large services, there&rsquo;s a single-purpose service; for example, Yelp rivals Google Places and Songkick competes with Facebook Events for concerts. I&rsquo;m left wondering, where is the line between email, Twitter, Facebook, Google+, Google Reader, Google Buzz, GitHub, LinkedIn, Tumblr, individual blogs, etc?</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s take an example of wanting to &ldquo;connect&rdquo; with your favorite programmer that you don&rsquo;t personally know. Facebook and LinkedIn are (or arguably should be) out. You can follow your favorite programmer on Twitter, but GitHub seems more appropriate. Now we have Google+ that sits somewhere between Facebook and Twitter, so you could find your favorite there as well. So which do you choose?</p>

<p>Taking another example of a band: MySpace may very well be the best way to connect with them. However, they will probably have Facebook and Twitter accounts as well as a personal site, and quite possibly, a personal blog. Do you follow their blog posts by periodically visiting the site or do you receive updates effortlessly using RSS? Are the posts replicated on Facebook or MySpace? Are the posts teased with tweets?</p>

<p>There are many more examples like brands (I should visit facebook.com/downy instead of their full site???), celebrities, government officials, etc.</p>

<p>So, where is the line between these services? How do you use the many different social services? Does it annoy you when companies &ldquo;misuse&rdquo; the services?</p>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/twitter-bots/">Twitter bots</a></h1>
      <p>I recently increased my activity on Twitter (meaning I started following a lot of people). After my flurry of activity I noticed something strange: for roughly every 10 people I followed, I had about 1 person follow me. Notice I did not say &ldquo;follow me back.&rdquo; In my case, these were some kind of bots that randomly follow people. I checked and they did not have people in common so it&rsquo;s not like they just follow everyone that Guy Kawasaki follows, but there&rsquo;s a definite spike in following based on twitter activity.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a crudely formatted profile from one of the spammers:</p>

<p>Whenever you navigate to Loren&rsquo;s profile page, you see a link to an adult site. I&rsquo;m baffled by the whole situation. Some questions keeping me up at night:</p>

<p><em>What is the ROI on an outfit like this?</em> Sure, you can automate virtually everything and you can mechanical turk out captcha solving and account creation for pennies, but do you gain anything from a twitter bot that randomly follows people (and nothing else)?</p>

<p><em>What is the purpose of following people?</em> It seems they simply want to drive traffic, but in the example above only 516 people would have seen the site. As I understand it, you won&rsquo;t gain any search engine cred beyond the twitter backlink (some think that retweets&mdash;abbreviated RT&mdash;might convey some power), and the bot&rsquo;s <a title="Klout for the twitter bot" href="http://klout.com/#/lorendisorda710">Klout score is insignificant</a> at 0-1 so they have virtually no influence.</p>

<p><em>Who would a real person follow these spammers back?</em> With 0 tweets the bots are simply not adding any value, so why would you want to connect with them? If you google for twitter users who follow back, you&rsquo;ll find a lot of people willing to trade follows. The most ridiculous I saw was a guy claiming that he would win a car if he could get enough followers. If you simply want to game the system and appear larger than life, this is one way to do it I guess&hellip; I&rsquo;d guess a lot of the people following the bots are bots themselves.</p>

<p><em>Why not automate tweeting too?</em> The programmers clearly have the Twitter API down, so why not pause for a random number of seconds then tweet something like, &ldquo;&lt;site name&gt; is &lt;adjective to draw people in&gt;&rdquo; and repeat. Even 1000 nearly identical tweets would look more reputable than 0.</p>

<p><em>How many accounts have been banned for the bot masters to fine-tune this process?</em> I suspect that following too many people at once would trigger a bot alarm and get your account banned; perhaps automated tweeting can be detected and squashed too. Given the amount of utter garbage being generated in bite-sized chunks, I don&rsquo;t think they have a filter in place :)</p>

<p><em>Capitalization and punctuation, really?</em> I must admit that I have a better impression of this twitter bot than I did of some previous ones that with descriptions that were hardly English. Again, I imagine this is a data driven decision so I would love to know how many accounts they tried with broken English/poor grammar and punctuation. Did foreigners and young people relate more to the informal style?</p>

<p><em>Who is behind twitter bots?</em> Is this all the work of HBGary and their persona management system under development when they were hacked by Anonymous? Probably not! I suspect the people in charge are not that sophisticated, although their motives are unclear to me.</p>

<p><em>How are the names chosen?</em> I figured the names were random, but then I dug a bit deeper. Interestingly enough, <a title="Klout for lorendisorda70" href="http://klout.com/#/lorendisorda70">@lorendisorda70 is a fairly popular person</a> so the @lorendisorda710 handle may be a ploy to attract typo prone or easily confused users.</p>

<p>Anyone have any thoughts?</p>

      <p>I&rsquo;m looking for the best way to determine a statistical model. I have a lot of data that comprises some (not all) variables and the associated outputs. Now, I would like to solve for the weights for the variables.</p>

<p>In the past I used Excel as well as a now defunct super spreadsheet application.  <a title="Weka from the University of Waikato" href="http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/">Weka</a> was recommended, but I&rsquo;m curious what other options exist. Is there a software package that will run different regressions, ultimately provided the best fit model?</p>

<p>Any help will be appreciated!</p>

<p>These apps use a variety of technologies including Java, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Python, Google (App Engine), Facebook (apps and ads), Twitter (apps), Heroku, jQuery, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, MySQL, git, SVN&hellip;</p>

<p>Beyond the above apps, I have played with browser extensions (Chrome and Firefox), blogging (Wordpress, Tumblr, Posterous, Blogger), Amazon (Web Services and Affiliate program), Google (search, AdWords, AdSense, Web Elements), Microsoft (BizSpark), iOS, Fog Creek (for Student and Startups &ndash; Kiln, FogBugz), node.js (including Joyent&rsquo;s SmartMachine). I&rsquo;ve read about many more, but haven&rsquo;t had a chance to implement anything yet. I&rsquo;m working to improve my business accumen, marketing abilities, and design skills. So much to do, so little time! But life is good :)</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m working on some other fun stuff now, but I&rsquo;ll save that for another post.</p>

      <p>Back in the day I used <a title="Firefox addon: Greasemonkey" href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/">Greasemonkey</a> and <a title="Firefox addon: Stylish" href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/stylish/">Stylish</a> for Firefox&mdash;even contributing something to <a title="Userscripts dot org" href="http://www.userscripts.org">userscripts.org</a> (a huge repository of GreaseMonkey and Stylish scripts). Chrome is currently my browser of choice, and I thought of how nice it would be to tweak sites using a little homegrown JavaScript. Turns out, Chrome has Greasemonkey&rsquo;s user script capability built-in.</p>

<p>Any file named &lt;whatever&gt;.user.js will be interpreted as a user script. Simply open the file in Chrome and install it. Now you have a dead simple Chrome extension! As you can see below, there are a couple steps in the install process:</p>

<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-1373" title="user script install step 1" src="/images/userscript-install-1.png" alt="user script install step 1" /></p>

<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-1374" title="user script install step 2" src="/images/userscript-install-2.png" alt="user script install step 2" /></p>

<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-1375" title="user script install step 3" src="/images/userscript-install-3.png" alt="user script install step 3" /></p>

<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-1376" title="user script install step 4" src="/images/userscript-install-4.png" alt="user script install step 4" /></p>

<p>I created an example user script for Chrome that hides the black bar now appearing that the top of Google sites. I chose Google Reader specifically to demonstrate the @include and @exclude options. You can find it here:  <a href="https://github.com/smholloway/miscellaneous/blob/master/javascript/simple.user.js" title="Seth Holloway's GitHub: simple user script"><a href="https://github.com/smholloway/miscellaneous/blob/master/javascript/simple.user.js">https://github.com/smholloway/miscellaneous/blob/master/javascript/simple.user.js</a></a></p>

      <p>Modern web programming requires a lot of knowledge&mdash;too much, I&rsquo;d say. To write a complete web application you need to work with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, a programming language (PHP, Python, Ruby, Java, etc), and a database. Even if you&rsquo;re a head-down back-end programmer, you should know about the structure and style of the front-end; as a front-end designer, you would do well to understand the framework and database.</p>

<p>There has been a huge explosion of web frameworks radically lowering the barrier to entry for any and all programmers. So, you know C++ and there&rsquo;s a C++ web framework, but you&rsquo;ll still need to know HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on the front-end and a database on the back-end. Node.js is potentially interesting for many reasons, but perhaps the most exciting thing is that you can program the front- and back-end using JavaScript. Better than having to learn JavaScript and a back-end language, but you will still need to know a database, HTML, and CSS.</p>

<p>As I see it, the shortest path would be a high-level programming language with an ORM (object relational mapper) that integrates template builders (something like mokk.me or Dreamweaver). The ORM abstracts out database specifics and allows the programmer to work with a more familiar construct, objects, while providing necessary methods like save, edit and delete. A template builder would visually handle HTML/CSS so that it feels more like design than development. Allowing components to be optimized later (replace or tweak the ORM with better SQL calls) would make the language/framework even better.</p>

<p>An alternative approach is an open source Flash-type language, that benefits from a standard plugin container. Sadly, in over 20 years of the web, the most integrated solution we have is Adobe Flash&mdash;a much maligned (insecure, bloated, slow, proprietary, &hellip;) language. For all its faults, Flash allowed people to create dynamic web pages that rendered uniformly&mdash;as designed&mdash;across browsers. Opening the spec may help as open specs are generally more secure and more optimized than closed versions. If the spec was open, people could write converters from various languages allowing everyone to produce the same output.</p>

<p>While we research an integrated web language there&rsquo;s also room for people to research a new application container. The web browser replacement could use the same stack (TCP/IP, HTTP and HTML) or define new protocols.</p>

<p>Did I miss an option? What do you think will win?</p>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/highlighting-the-current-page-link-in-a-navigation-bar-template/">Highlighting the current page link in a navigation bar template</a></h1>
      <p>I have not seen anything about how to properly highlight what page you&rsquo;re currently on when using a templated navigation bar on a dynamic webpage&hellip; I couldn&rsquo;t even google for a solution because I don&rsquo;t know the correct terminology.</p>

<p>There are a number of ways to highlight the link to the page you&rsquo;re currently on. For example, you could pass a parameter and alter the view based on the parameter; or you could include the navigation pane in each content view then apply the highlight with the page. I don&rsquo;t think either of those solutions is very clean, so here&rsquo;s my solution using HTML, CSS, and jQuery (it should work across browsers).</p>

<pre>&lt;!-- index.html --&gt;</pre>


<pre>&lt;div id="topnav"&gt;</pre>


<pre>   &lt;ul&gt;</pre>


<pre>       &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="home"&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</pre>


<pre>       &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="about"&gt;About&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</pre>


<pre>       &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="links"&gt;Links&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</pre>


<pre>       &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="services"&gt;Services&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</pre>


<pre>       &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="contact"&gt;Contact&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</pre>


<pre>   &lt;/ul&gt;</pre>


<pre>&lt;/div&gt;</pre>


<p>The unordered list is styled as a standard navigation menu (A List Apart has a nice article and book about it), and I have it setup to highlight whatever menu item is hovered. To highlight the current page, I set that item to the same background color as the hover effect. A little snippet here:</p>

<pre>/* application.css */</pre>


<pre>a:hover, a:focus { background: #454d2f; }</pre>


<pre>.highlight { background: #454d2f; }</pre>


<p>Now, all that&rsquo;s left is to let jQuery apply the highlight class to the menu item corresponding to the page we&rsquo;re on; an effect I achieve thusly:</p>

<pre>// application.js</pre>


<pre>$('#topnav').ready(function() {
    var page = window.location.href.split("/")[3]; // after the slash at the end of the domain name 
    if (page == "") { page = "home"; }
    $(this).find("a[href$="+page+"]").addClass("highlight"); 
});</pre>


<p>You could do this without jQuery, but it is my favorite JavaScript library and I like to use it :)</p>

<p>Does anyone know of a better way?</p>
