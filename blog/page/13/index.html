      <p>I had my Google Adsense account banned. As you can see below, it is completely unclear why I might have been banned&hellip; was it related to my two previous hacks? was it a bored Chinese hacker clicking all my links? was it the Russian Business Network testing their click fraud ring on my site? was it that I had unusual traffic or unusual content or unusual amounts of clicks? I think it is because I randomly blogged about mesothelioma then had a day where I made $11 from ads (beating my previous best day by $11). The email titled &#8221;Google AdSense Account Disabled&#8221; only had this to say:</p>

Hello,

After reviewing our records, we&#8217;ve determined that your AdSense account
poses a risk of generating invalid activity. Because we have a
responsibility to protect our AdWords advertisers from inflated costs due
to invalid activity, we&#8217;ve found it necessary to disable your AdSense
account. Your outstanding balance and Google&#8217;s share of the revenue will
both be fully refunded back to the affected advertisers.

Please understand that we need to take such steps to maintain the
effectiveness of Google&#8217;s advertising system, particularly the
advertiser-publisher relationship. We understand the inconvenience that
this may cause you, and we thank you in advance for your understanding and
cooperation.

If you have any questions or concerns about the actions we&#8217;ve taken, how
you can appeal this decision, or invalid activity in general, you can find
more information by visiting

Sincerely,

The Google AdSense Team</blockquote>


<p>I appealed the decision thinking (1) it is worth a shot, (2) I&rsquo;m a small fish, and (3) the terms of service state that clicking your own ads yields invalid clicks, which led me to believe clicks from the owners account were filtered. Apparently, instead of filtering your clicks, they ban you.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the automated message from my appeal.</p>

<blockquote>Hello,

Thank you for your appeal. We appreciate the additional information you&#8217;ve
provided, as well as your continued interest in the AdSense program.
However, after thoroughly re-reviewing your account data and taking your
feedback into consideration, our specialists have confirmed that we&#8217;re
unable to reinstate your AdSense account.

As a reminder, if you have any questions or concerns about your account,

<p>I&rsquo;m left wondering &ldquo;What if you see an interesting ad on your own page?&rdquo; &ldquo;How motivated is Google to find click fraud when ads account for almost all of their revenue?&rdquo; &ldquo;What percentage of the population is Google willing to ban?&rdquo; Along those lines, Google Will Eat Itself (<a title="Google Will Eat Itself" href="http://gwei.org/index.php"><a href="http://gwei.org/index.php">http://gwei.org/index.php</a></a>) is a performance art group that has a click fraud ring going. The proceeds of this duplicitous venture are being plowed into Google stock. In a mere 200,000 years the group can own all of Google.</p>

<p>This was a painful lesson to learn. I messed up. In my opinion, the terms of service should be more clear and Google should either speak bluntly about black hat and bannable offenses, or not assume that offenders are black hatters worthy of a ban. Also, the minimalistic feature robot that is Google should offer more explanation for why accounts were banned and at least give the impression that a human is involved in the process&ndash;it is hard to bond with a cold, automated company.</p>

<p>In defense of Google, they offer a great, easy-to-use service with competitive payouts. (It is shocking that no other advertising company has caught on.) I do wish they were more lenient on first offenses from nobodies. Live and learn!</p>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/software-certifications-good-bad-ugly/">Software certifications: good, bad, or ugly?</a></h1>
      <p>If you asked me today, I&rsquo;d say I am in favor of certifications and accreditation. If a professional organization offered a worthwhile broad certification, software may be a very different beast. I have seen the power of certifications through my friends in accounting and actuarial sciences; both professions are bolstered by their professional certification. I posit that software can be written by anyone, but maybe it shouldn&rsquo;t be; with the proper certification we could increase code quality, security, safety, and base knowledge.</p>

<p>One could point out that software development currently has certifications such as those offered by Microsoft and Cisco, as well as a number of lesser-known bodies offering certifications in software testing and other areas. I find these certifications to be flimsy and unnecessarily specific&ndash;very different than the meaningful equivalent certification offered by a state&rsquo;s bar exam (for lawyers).</p>

<p>Beyond ensuring a base set of knowledge, we could keep jobs that are being offshored and outsourced. How? The government requires that any company receiving federal money has to employ certified U.S. software developers. Now companies have a choice: cheap labor or government money. Certifications give funding bodies and customers one more knob to turn when deciding how much money to give or who to hire.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve seen certification debated by some people who talk about how it would not work if imposed today. That&rsquo;s true, but looking years into the future there could be a robust industry built on the backs of people willing to jump through hoops in order to focus on their craft. Today, a high school kid could be a lawyer, except for the bar exam; the same prodigious youth could be a doctor, except for the certification. Uncertified people may even be better than their educated counterparts, but judging by who we go to for legal advice and medical help, few people care to take a chance on those unwilling or unable to take the tests. Our society is built on signaling mechanisms that reward dedication to a craft; software certifications would be no different.</p>

<p>Googling for the benefits of professional certifications I came across a number of interesting studies and opinions. Argument from authority was common as people state how certifications exist for law, medicine, accounting, personal training, social work, education, and more; this makes certifications popular, not right. Determining what certification exams is a really hard problem, and centralizing the power stands to create corruption and slow the industry. Certification also works to unionize professionals and redistribute wealth. From a laziness standpoint, certifications layer on a lot of work and responsibility.</p>

<p>So, given the advantages and disadvantages, are certifications in software good, bad, or just plain ugly?</p>

      <p>I&rsquo;m learning a ton this summer as I relearn old tricks and learn new tricks. Among other technologies, frameworks, languages, and techniques, I&rsquo;m improving my Java skills. A friend recommended <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0321356683/?tag=theven01-20">Joshua Block&rsquo;s Effective Java Version 2</a>. The introduction succinctly states that the book aims to improve your usage of Java&ndash;something not usually taught in classes or discussed in book. Here are a few things I (re)learned:</p>

<ul>
<li>Local variables should be instantiated; if you cannot assign a sane default value, you shouldn&rsquo;t be assigning the variable yet.</li>
<li>Variables should be located near their use. In the C style you would declare all variables at the top of the method; however, this is not the best practice in modern Java. (Does anyone know if the &lsquo;variables at top&rsquo; still reigns in C?)</li>
<li>while loops should be used only if you need the local index variable outside the loop</li>
<li>For-each loops should be used whenever possible</li>
<li><p>The next best loop is a for loop with the end condition assigned in the loop (a technique I believe we could weakly call <a title="Wikipedia: memoization" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization">memoization</a> because we only have to calculate something once), for example:</p>

<p> for (int i = 0, len = myDataStructure.calculateSomething(); i &lt; len; i++) {
     // do something
 }</p></li>

<p>For the second: Junior, J.R., June, Chip, Duece, Two, Bud, &lt;First name initial&gt;.J. (e.g., Seth Jr. would be S.J.), Little &lt;Name&gt; (e.g., Little Seth), Younger &lt;Name&gt; (e.g., Younger Seth), Skip (particularly if the name skipped a generation), Sonny</p>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/scripting-heroku-backups/">Scripting Heroku backups</a></h1>
      <p>I was looking for a way to backup applications on Heroku and found a few options. There&rsquo;s a Rails plugin that stores your backups on Amazon S3 (<a title="Heroku S3 Backup plugin" href="https://github.com/edavis10/heroku_s3_backup"><a href="https://github.com/edavis10/heroku_s3_backup">https://github.com/edavis10/heroku_s3_backup</a></a>), but I am satisfied with local backups.</p>

<p>So I updated an existing solution (<a title="Ben Scheirman's blog" href="http://flux88.com/2010/02/scripting-heroku-backups/"><a href="http://flux88.com/2010/02/scripting-heroku-backups/">http://flux88.com/2010/02/scripting-heroku-backups/</a></a>) based on Heroku&rsquo;s updated documentation (<a title="Heroku Docs: pgbackups" href="http://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/pgbackups"><a href="http://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/pgbackups">http://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/pgbackups</a></a>).</p>

<pre># lib/tasks/backup.rake

# Create a backup of a Rails application deployed to Heroku
# Technique taken from Ben Scheirman - http://flux88.com/2010/02/scripting-heroku-backups/
# Place file in lib/tasks/backup.rake (replace your_app_name with your application's Heroku name)
# Invoke using rake your_app_name:backup
# Dependencies: the heroku gem, the pgbackups heroku addon
namespace :your_app_name do
    desc 'Captures a heroku backup. Ensure you have the heroku gem and pgbackups addon installed\n
                gem install heroku &amp;&amp; heroku addons:add pgbackups'

    task :backup do
        # capture the backup bundle
        timestamp = `date -u '+%Y-%m-%d-%H-%M'`.chomp
        bundle_name = "your_app_name-#{timestamp}"
        puts "Capturing bundle #{bundle_name}..."
        `heroku pgbackups:capture --app your_app_name '#{bundle_name}'`

        # download &amp; destroy the bundle we just captured
        puts "Downloading bundle #{bundle_name}.dump"
        backup_url = `heroku pgbackups:url`
        `curl -o '#{bundle_name}'.dump '#{backup_url}'`

        # move the backup
        puts "Moving bundle to backups/#{bundle_name}.dump"
        `mkdir backups/`
        `mv '#{bundle_name}'.dump backups/#{bundle_name}.dump`
    end
end</pre>


<p>I&rsquo;ve also uploaded the file to my github account: <a title="Seth Holloway's GitHub" href="https://github.com/smholloway/miscellaneous/blob/master/rails/backup.rake"><a href="https://github.com/smholloway/miscellaneous/blob/master/rails/backup.rake">https://github.com/smholloway/miscellaneous/blob/master/rails/backup.rake</a></a></p>

<p>There are a lot of things you could do to extend this further; for example, you could create a cron job to run the task periodically or schedule a few minutes every week to make the backups.</p>

<p>Let me know if you can improve this or if you find it useful.</p>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/people-selling-their-own-vehicles/">People selling their own vehicles</a></h1>
      <p>I&rsquo;ve become fascinated with the way that people signal they are selling their vehicles. Virtually everytime I drive somewhere, I see a car that is for sale by owner.</p>

<p>Here are a few styles I&rsquo;ve seen:</p>

<blockquote>$555-5555

This ambiguous note seems to say &#8220;for sale&#8221; by using a dollar sign ($) butted up against a phone number. The &#8220;for sale&#8221; and telephone number are not clear, so maybe that&#8217;s just the price range.</blockquote>




<blockquote>4-sale 555-555-5555

I like this one. If I saw this car while on a road trip, I&#8217;d know it was available and how to contact the seller.</blockquote>




<blockquote>sale 555-555-5555

Not bad, but are they selling their phone number? The note could be more clearly written.</blockquote>




<p><blockquote>180k $800 5555555</p>

<p>Without more context, I have to interpret this myself. I assume it means the seller wants $800 for their 180,000 mile car and they can be reached at 5555555 (or was that 555555 or 55555555?).</p>

<p><blockquote> $1000 OBO</p>

<p>Here, &ldquo;OBO&rdquo; means &ldquo;or best offer&rdquo; showing that the seller is negotiable on price. I tend to think most prices are negotiable, particularly when dealing with individuals, however, the &ldquo;OBO&rdquo; conveys a great willingness to work with the seller (probably a good thing). Should I just flag down the owner and negotiate while driving?</blockquote></p>

<p>The personal car advertisement brings up questions of usability and efficiency in generating sales. What&rsquo;s most effective? What information is necessary? I don&rsquo;t know, but here are a few thoughts:</p>

<ul>
<li>The only constant among the advertisements seems to be a phone number. I think this makes sense, since the buyer needs a way to contact the seller and make the transaction.</li>
<li>In general, I think it&rsquo;s short sighted to put only a 7 digit phone number. Cars, and the people contained within, are mobile. It&rsquo;s not unreasonable to think that you may leave your area code or have others enter yours.</li>
<li>Putting too much information feels counter-productive.</li>
<li>Numbers like price or number of miles are very hard to differentiate from phone number</li>
<li>It is very difficult to assess the vehicle and write down the phone number while driving, so stationary vehicles are probably more effective.</li>
</ul>


<p>I would recommend a clearly written advertisement on the back windshield that states the intention to sell (&ldquo;for sale&rdquo;) and a contact phone number (10 digits, appropriately separated with dashes). In conjunction, list your car on craigslists, ebay motors, zip zoom auto, and tell your friends verbally and over facebook. And one high-tech idea: put a QR code on a sheet of paper in the window. Boom!</p>

      <p>As I see it, few professional organizations are worth it. I think professional organizations should work hard to provide value to their members. At this point there&rsquo;s not a lot that we need them for. Perhaps IEEE could increase their credibility by maintaining a list of up-to-date information written by industry leaders. That way, they may not have the industry leaders, but they at least acknowledge cutting-edge work and become a great central location. Maybe IEEE should be competing with Hacker News, Reddit, Digg, and Slashdot. Some other ideas for how they could add value: promotions (look at the App Store to learn how a big organization can help individuals flourish); local meetups; really solid job postings with matching and recommendations (and throw in career counseling available over the phone or chat); facilitate in finding funding for your tech work; &ldquo;Ask an expert&rdquo; chats. And my biggest wish as I embark on a journey into self-employment: group insurance. Why doesn&rsquo;t IEEE leverage its membership base to provide competitive health insurance? Insurance companies cannot reject individuals who buy in to a group plan, and it keeps the premiums low for the group. Want to add value? Provide an entrepreneurship insurance. They could probably flex their muscles and help skilled foreigners with visas. I&rsquo;m not a lawyer, but couldn&rsquo;t IEEE provide a service that costs the price of a visa sponsorship? Join our group and you can be sponsored for a visa for $PRICE_OF_VISA.</p>

<p>UPDATE: From what I can tell, IEEE does not currently offer group health insurance. They have spam mails for different insurance plans and they offer short-term medical through their site. The spam is obnoxious and the short-term medical is worse than what you can purchase easily online.</p>

<p>What do you think? How can professional organizations be more useful?</p>

<p>Scales are a series of notes derived with a set pattern. The root note defines the scale. Let me explain further with two scales that only contain the natural notes (no sharps or flats): A minor and C major. A minor and C major are &lsquo;enharmonic&rsquo; meaning they are the same notes;  the difference between the scales is the root note and the pattern that you follow to find the next note. Observe:</p>

<div>
<div>
<blockquote>A minor scale

Notes: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, A

Frets on the E string: 5, 7, 8, 10, 12, 13, 15, 17

Pattern (intervals between notes): root, +2, +1, +2, +2, +1, +2, +2

C major scale

Notes: C, D, E, F, G, A, B, C

Frets on the E string: 8, 10, 12, 13, 15, 17, 19, 20

Pattern (intervals between notes): root, +2, +2, +1, +2, +2, +2, +1</blockquote>

<p>You can play a minor scale by picking the root note then applying the minor pattern: root, +2, +1, +2, +2, +1, +2, +2. In the same way, you can play a major scale by picking a root note then applying the major pattern: root, +2, +2, +1, +2, +2, +2, +1. Another example:</p>

<blockquote>A major scale

Notes: A, B, C#, D, E, F#, G#, A

Frets on the E string: 5, 7, 9, 10, 12, 14, 16, 17

Pattern (intervals between notes): root, +2, +2, +1, +2, +2, +2, +1</blockquote>


<p>In music theory terms, the +1 difference is called a &ldquo;half-tone&rdquo; difference and the +2 is termed a &ldquo;whole tone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If you play notes (mostly) from one scale, you are said to be in that key. For example, if you play notes (mostly) from the E scale, you&rsquo;re in the key of E (major is generally implied&ndash;minor must be stated).</p>

<p>From scales, we can derive chords. Chords are groups of notes. The basic chord is 3 notes: 1 (root), 3, 5 of the scale.</p>

<p>An A minor chord contains the notes A, C, E (1, 3, 5 of the A minor scale).</p>

<p>The C major chord contains C, E, G (1, 3, 5 of the C major scale).</p>

<p>And the A major chord contains A, C#, E (1, 3, 5 of the A major scale).</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s a quick, high-level overview of the basis of all music. Now, rock on! \m/</p>
