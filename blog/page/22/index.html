      <p>I recently discovered the <a title="Software Engineering Genealogy" href="http://people.engr.ncsu.edu/txie/sefamily.htm" target="_blank">Software Engineering Academic Genealogy</a>. For those outside the ivory tower, this genealogy mirrors standard human breeding records. In the not-so-distant future I will be an indentation under <a title="Christine's awesomely outdated page :)" href="http://www.ece.utexas.edu/%7Ejulien/" target="_blank">Christine Julien</a>, below <a title="Gruia Catalin Roman" href="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/%7Eroman" target="_blank">Gruia-Catalin Roman</a>. Standard genealogical terms apply in the academic version as well; for example, Christine is my academic parent.</p>

<p>Just as in humans, breed history can be an important determination of future success. A descendant of a well-known researcher will have high expectations to perform like their academic ancestor, but this is also a great way to position oneself for the job one desires. For example, if you want to be a professor, ensure that your advisor has graduated other students who became faculty. Unfortunately, this way of thinking favors older professors and can make it hard for new faculty to establish themselves despite their fresh ideas and tenacity. As with humans, genealogy comes with no guarantees! Individuals create their own track records. An advisor&rsquo;s personality and research should play into the perspective student&rsquo;s decision. Find an <a title="Sensor Enablement for the Average Programmer" href="http://mpc.ece.utexas.edu/SEAP/" target="_blank">interesting topic</a> and do it well!</p>

<p>While we&rsquo;re on the subject, another fun genealogical term borrowed by scholars is &ldquo;<a title="Luis Von Ahn discusses his &quot;imbred&quot; hiring" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wXsQxZLEEc" target="_blank">academic imbreeding</a>&rdquo; or &ldquo;academic incest&rdquo; which refers to the taboo practice of hiring people from the host university.</p>

<p>And that concludes today&rsquo;s lecture. Visit me in my office hours if you have any questions. Have a nice weekend!</p>

      <p>As I&rsquo;ve said <a title="Seth Holloway: World Religion Visual" href="http://sethholloway.com/blog/2009/07/12/world-relgions-visual/" target="_blank">before</a>, I&rsquo;m a sucker for effective visualizations. In this age of &ldquo;<a title="Wikipedia: American Energy Independence" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_energy_independence" target="_blank">energy independence</a>&rdquo; I was really taken aback by this visual: the energy generation, transmission, and consumption in the U.S. Given the complexity of the information and sheer volume of data to present, I think this visual does an excellent job. (Other interesting visuals are available on the Lawrence Livermore site <a title="Energy at Lawrence Livermore" href="https://eed.llnl.gov/flow/" target="_blank">here</a>. Thanks to <a title="Drew Stovall" href="http://www.dstovall.com/" target="_blank">Drew</a> for sharing this with me.)</p>

<p>Notice how little energy alternative sources are producing. Also, notice that we&rsquo;re losing a ton of energy to transmission. In fact, if we could halve transmission losses we could eliminate all imports.</p>

<p>Does anything else stand out to you? More notable points than mine? Is the graphic missing data that you would like to see? Is energy independence truly achievable?</p>

<p><a title="Luis von Ahn at the Library of Congress" href="http://vonahn.blogspot.com/2009/06/speaking-at-library-of-congress.html" target="_blank"><a href="http://vonahn.blogspot.com/2009/06/speaking-at-library-of-congress.html">http://vonahn.blogspot.com/2009/06/speaking-at-library-of-congress.html</a></a></p>

<p>The talk covers the basics of a CAPTCHA (the hard-to-read words that verify you are human when signing up for online accounts) then discusses the recaptcha. The recaptcha pairs two random English words together so it can yield some funky phrases such as the &ldquo;desert voter&rdquo; shown below. (Watch the video for much better pairings!) The recaptcha uses one known word and one word that cannot be read by a machine. By distributing the otherwise unreadable word to multiple people, von Ahn is able to effortlessly digitize the written word. I respect and admire the ingenuity here. Dr. von Ahn simultaneously repels spammers and digitizes books!</p>

<p>This work provides two great insights to me: (1) humans are still better than computers at some things and (2) harnessing intelligence in a scalable way can have dramatic results.

      <p>Over the weekend I went to Florida for a family reunion. Overall, I had a wonderful time; the biggest inconvenience was travel. Airports and air transportation are awful. It baffles me that everyone I talk to agrees (surely this sentiment is mirrored by more than the tens of people I&rsquo;ve spoken to), yet there are no improvements or innovations. I understand airplanes cost enormous amounts of money and there is a mountain of bureaucracy, but that does not placate me. On our most recent flight it occurred to me that airline seating is a 3-way optimization, yet no system mirrors the thought process. Seating is all about the location! There are three specific concerns:</p>

<ul>
<li>Sitting with specific people (people)</li>
<li>Sitting in a specific location relative to the entire plane (location)</li>
<li>Sitting in a specific location relative to the row (seat)</li>
</ul>


<p>A fair system would allow people to rank their priorities, then the system can simultaneously satisfy the highest number of people. This may seem a little abstract so allow me to illustrate with an example; here&rsquo;s my ideal:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>High Priority</strong>. <em>People</em>: I want to sit with Andrea Holloway</li>
<li><strong>Medium Priority</strong>. <em>Seat</em>: I want to sit on the aisle</li>
<li><strong>Low Priority</strong>. <em>Location</em>: I want to sit over the wing</li>
</ul>


<p>Why doesn&rsquo;t this simple system exist? Am I right about the three categories? How would you prioritize?</p>

      <p>I&rsquo;m a fan of effective visuals. I&rsquo;m also a fan of world religions. Boy, was I in luck whenever I received this link! It&rsquo;s a rather interesting perspective on how different religions generally feel about a few hot-button issues.</p>

<p>Going just on these issues, could one&rsquo;s beliefs align more strongly with a religion other than their own? Does your self-described religion share your beliefs on these issues? Are there more important issues to you?</p>

<p>J.P. Knight left a much easier solution in the comments. If you want to see all of your citations the easy way, simply put the \nocite{*} command into your latex file as seen below.</p>

<blockquote>\documentclass[11pt]{report}
\usepackage{natbib}

<p>I&rsquo;m currently writing my dissertation (technically my proposal) in <a title="LaTeX Official Page" href="http://www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX</a> (think Microsoft Word without the WYSIWYG interface). As I&rsquo;m searching for citations, I am overwhelmed at the number of sources in my bibtex file. Rather than staring at the bland, perhaps bloated, syntax with curly braces, spaces, and commas, I created a little script that would let me see how the citations will look in the paper&mdash;in a nice PDF bibliography. Here, I present seeAllCitations.sh which takes in your bibtex file as an argument and creates a file with all of your potential citations. After the script completes, just &ldquo;compile&rdquo; the file as you normally would and open the resulting pdf/dvi.</p>

<blockquote>#!/bin/sh

# Check input for one argument
if [ $# -ne 1 ]; then
echo &#8220;Please input your .bib file as an argument&#8221;
echo &#8220;Example: ./seeAllCitations.sh proposal.bib&#8221;
exit 1
fi

#  Create the file
echo &#8220;Creating seeAllCitations.tex that will allow you to see all citations.&#8221;

# Create a simple tex file that will include citations

\n
&#92;\bibliographystyle{abbrv}

<p>See any mistakes? Was that at all helpful? Do you have a different (read: better) method for checking your citations?</p>

      <p>&ldquo;When do you wet your toothbrush?&rdquo; an uncle once asked me. I don&rsquo;t remember how it came up, but my reply was &ldquo;before and after I put on the toothpaste.&rdquo; He quickly replied, &ldquo;Then you&rsquo;re a freak!&rdquo; I paused to think about my action and, after some rumination, I stated my case: &ldquo;I wet the toothbrush first so the paste goes onto soft bristles. I wet the toothbrush again to soften the toothpaste.&rdquo; Of course, doing this wetting ritual only once would achieve the same effect, but it&rsquo;s my routine!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve always been a bit of an optimizer: I try to accomplish the most tasks in the shortest amount of time, so it struck me odd that I was wasting time, not to mention water, by wetting my toothbrush twice. Even now, I catch myself falling into the old routine. Old habits die hard, but we must keep improving!</p>

<p>So, am I a freak for wetting the bristles twice? When do you wet your toothbrush? What are you doing more efficiently now? What routine can you simlpy not break?</p>

      <p>I&rsquo;m a generalist. I love life. I love people. I love technology. I love sports. I love games. I love philosophy (religion, politics, physics, etc.). I love food. I love music. I love love. I love lists ;&ndash;)</p>

<p>Growing up I heard a lot of conventional wisdom that being well-rounded is good. However, as I&rsquo;ve gotten older I&rsquo;ve felt a shocking lack of suggestions to be broad. Perhaps my senses are more keen at only finding differences, but I have found numerous proponents of specialization. However, I&rsquo;m a damn good generalist so I&rsquo;ll have to content myself with hopes of being a polymath.</p>

<p>Watching Nathan Myhrvold&rsquo;s TED talk (embedded below) gave me hope that it is okay to be broad. From archeology to penguin poop to barbeque, he does it all with nary a thread to tie the activities together. Rather than try to define himself as a computer scientist or a researcher, he simply does what he enjoys.</p>

<p>What do you think? Are you broad or specific? Is it working for you? Is there a winning formula for either (specializing or generalizing)? Myhrvold is one example of a generalist who succeeded, are there others?</p>
