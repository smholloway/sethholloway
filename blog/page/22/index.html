      <p>I came across a website that <a title="Obama CTO" href="http://obamacto.org/" target="_blank">tallies votes on technological ideas that the Obama CTO</a> will hopefully take to heart. I like the voting scheme employed; you&rsquo;re given 10 votes and you can give up to three votes per idea&ndash;kind of like the <a title="wikipedia Condorcet" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet_method" target="_blank">Condorcet voting method</a> <a title="seth holloway dot com comments" href="http://sethholloway.com/blog/?p=205" target="_blank">I learned about</a> during this presidential election.</p>

<p>I agreed with the top three choices (net neutrality, repeal the patriot act, and repeal the DMCA), so these received one vote each. I also put one point into restoring DARPA because I&rsquo;m a fan of futuristic research that may have no commercial impacts for years to come. I put three votes towards more research into energy and rethinking IP law because those are two of my biggest technological pet peeves.</p>

<p>The site has a lot of good ideas, although I would like to see more about security. All the money and technology in the world will be useless if we do not have control of our own machines. America has criminalized hacking rather than studying it; without knowledge of hacking, how can we stop it?</p>

<p>I would also like to see more push for improving technological infrastructure so that America can continue to compete in the future. We know the theory, but other nations are actually implementing these cool ideas.</p>

<p>In your opinion is the site missing any good ideas? Where did you put your 10 votes?</p>

      <p>Today is a very exciting day for the <a title="SSE" href="http://www.edge.utexas.edu/sse/" target="_blank">Students in Software Engineering</a> (SSE)! <a title="Ambler's homepage" href="http://users.ece.utexas.edu/~ambler/" target="_blank">Chairman Ambler</a> will be presenting today. He is ostensibly the biggest name we have had yet and we expect a large turnout. I hope we got enough food!</p>

<p>In a similar vein, the updated <a title="Software Engineering at UT" href="http://www.edge.utexas.edu/se/" target="_blank">Software Engineering website</a> is up. I think it looks clean while intuitively presenting all the useful information.</p>

<p>On a completely unrelated note&hellip; <a title="Rock Auto" href="https://www.rockauto.com/" target="_blank">Rock Auto part</a>s is an amazing online catalog of (believe it or not) auto parts. I was able to find a random knob for an affordable $6! If you need some parts, check it out.</p>

<p>Also, if you haven&rsquo;t seen this site before, <a title="123People" href="http://www.123people.com/" target="_blank">123 peopl</a>e aggregates online information about people. Apparently I have a web presence that I can be proud of. Do you?</p>

      <p>I feel like I should write about something more insightful because of the title, but instead I&rsquo;m linking (hence a <a title="10 body hacks" href="http://lifehacker.com/software/lifehacker-top-10/top-10-body-hacks-257746.php" target="_blank">link)</a> to 10 things you can learn to do with your body. My father in law can whistle like a New Yorker. Reading <a title="10 body hacks" href="http://lifehacker.com/software/lifehacker-top-10/top-10-body-hacks-257746.php" target="_blank">this article</a> has given me insight into how to do <a title="Google answers on whistling" href="http://answers.google.com/answers/threadview?id=419588" target="_blank">the same</a>&ndash;and nine other tricks. Some are lame or ill-explained, but we take the good with the bad.</p>

<p>My grandpa and Jason can make their ears wiggle like jello on a washing machine! Unfortunately, that one was not covered in the article, so I may never know how to do it&hellip; I can flare my nostrils though! Go me!</p>

<p>On the serious side, now is a good time to learn a new skill and expand your network in order to improve your chances of being employed. As Mike told me, people should have two separate careers. I&rsquo;m a grad student and a maverick&ndash;I think my future is bright!</p>

      <p>The Economist has an <a title="Fallibility of scientific journals" href="http://www.economist.com/science/displayStory.cfm?story_id=12376658" target="_blank">interesting article</a> about the nature of scientific publications&ndash;namely that research is wrong. The author points out that overstating your research will increase the chances of it getting noticed and getting published. Scientific research has become big business: publish or perish! Two major points that I find to be true (unfortunately):</p>

<ul>
<li>Negative results are not publishable.</li>
<li>Big, bold claims are more likely to get published than incremental updates.</li>
</ul>


<p>The Internet has made <a title="Techdirt said it first" href="http://techdirt.com/articles/20080922/0331332329.shtml" target="_blank">everyone a publisher</a> so many traditional institutions need to be reformed. Research is not immune. The article suggests that, rather than trusting journals, all quality above some threshold be published.</p>

<p>Good points. Interesting solutions. Any dissenters out there?</p>

      <p>This morning I was inspired by a speech from <a title="wikipedia: Dave Eggers" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Eggers" target="_blank">Dave Eggers</a>, one of three 2008 TED prize ($100,000) winners. In <a title="Dave Eggers in 4 minutes on TED" href="http://blog.ted.com/2008/10/dave_eggers_in.php" target="_blank">this clip</a> Dave talks about how we, the people, can help the educational system. The idea is simple:</p>

<object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="425" height="344" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/l3QbzvT6vko&amp;color1=0xb1b1b1&amp;color2=0xcfcfcf&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="344" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/l3QbzvT6vko&amp;color1=0xb1b1b1&amp;color2=0xcfcfcf&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object>


<p>As you&rsquo;ll see in the video, Austin has a similar center called the <a title="Austin Bat Cave" href="http://www.austinbatcave.org/Home.html" target="_blank">Austin Bat Cave</a>. (Apparently it&rsquo;s not officially <a title="wikipedia: 826 National" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/826_National" target="_blank">826 National</a>, but it follows in the same vein.)</p>

<p>I think Dave has an excellent, inspirational idea that should be replicated all over. Anyone interested in starting the central Austin center?</p>

      <p>What do elephants, humans, and bacteria have in common? Probably a lot, but the answer I&rsquo;m looking for is the amount of energy we use. Scientists have found that <a title="Wired article" href="http://blog.wired.com/wiredscience/2008/10/scientists-comp.html" target="_blank">all living things use roughly the same amount of energy</a>. It seems this study contradicts earlier research. I&rsquo;m interested to find out more, especially after reporting on <a title="Seth Holloway dot com: Tardigrade" href="http://sethholloway.com/blog/?p=103" target="_blank">Tardigrade </a>that can survive all kinds of crazy conditions. Even humans seem to burn different amount of energy (think of the skinny guy who can eat anything), although I doubt that&rsquo;s an order of magnitude different among species.</p>

      <p>As I mentioned earlier, <a title="Rock Band 2 is out -- SethHolloway.com" href="http://sethholloway.com/blog/?p=114" target="_blank">Rock Band 2 is out</a>. <a title="Guitar Hero Official Site" href="http://www.guitarhero.com/" target="_blank">Guitar Hero</a>: <a title="Guitar Hero World Tour" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar_Hero_IV" target="_blank">World Tour</a> (a.k.a. Guitar Hero IV) is not far behind. These games are doing extremely well, and I&rsquo;m not surprised. I have fond memories of playing the original <a title="Nintendo Power Pad" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_Pad" target="_blank">Power Pad</a> for Nintendo. I&rsquo;m glad to see a new generation of novel input devices for games because games have really stuck with standard controls for the last 15 years. Sure, there was a <a title="Duck Hunt Gun" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_hunt_gun" target="_blank">Zapper</a>, <a title="Power GLOVES!" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_glove" target="_blank">Power Glove</a>, <a title="Donkey Kong Bongos!" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donkey_Kong_Jungle_Beat" target="_blank">Donkey Kong Bongos</a>, and <a title="DDR" href="http://www.ddrfreak.com/aboutddr.php" target="_blank">DDR</a>, but games have not explored the space until recently. Think of the slew of games for the <a title="App Store" href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/appstore/" target="_blank">iPhone</a>, the Wii, and instrument-driven games&ndash;we&rsquo;ve only seen the tip of the iceberg! Beyond that, research into augmented reality (it&rsquo;s like virtual reality) has come a long way. This is an exciting time for gamers, indeed.</p>

<p>Beyond being a great time for gamers, it&rsquo;s a great time for developers! iPhone developers are doing well, the same could be possible for anyone related to music! There is a huge opportunity for instrument-driven games, but game makers and the RIAA <a title="Activision CEO wants more!" href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20081001/0245102424.shtml" target="_blank">can&rsquo;t determine how to divide the massive profits</a> (Rock band has <a title="21M downloaded songs" href="http://www.streetinsider.com/Press+Releases/MTV+Games,+Harmonix+and+Electronic+Arts+Ship+Rock+Band+2(TM)+for+XBOX+360(R)/3980528.html" target="_blank">over 21M song downloads</a>; Guitar Hero has <a title="10M songs downloaded" href="http://www.joystiq.com/2008/05/02/rock-band-ships-3-million-bundled-units-10-million-songs-down/" target="_blank">over 10M song downloads</a>).</p>

<p>Rock Band/Guitar Hero should take a page from Apple and publish a development kit. This development kit would allow people to put music into a format usable by instrument-driven games. Make it easy for people to create content and let them do the development for you! Hosting is cheap: set up a repository for musicians to submit their transcribed songs into and allow users to access the library; sell advertising, let musicians or the free market determine pricing; split profits.</p>

<p>These platforms are a great way to get your music known! There are opportunities for challenging songs, easy songs, fun party songs and more! Obscure and popular bands alike can profit. And fans would profit too. If the average person could grasp song structure and technical difficulty, it would educate the masses on music, allow more people into the creative process, raise the bar on musicians, and generally be awesome.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d also like to see new games being developed using the existing novel input devices. Now that we have gyros and guitars, innovate on the ways to use the tools. It can be done; <a title="Devil May Cry using Guitar Hero 3 controller" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CREs25IcHAU" target="_blank">check out</a> this kid playing Devil May Cry with the Guitar Hero axe.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s so much possibility! The time is right for novel input devices. Let&rsquo;s hope that content developers, hosting providers, and platform creators can agree on models that are good for the consumer.</p>

      <p>I had an idea for a website that would cover one issue per day. Clean and simple; just one issue per day. The idea came after I got frustrated with the amount of clutter on various news sites, and while there is a lot of overlap, to really keep up with the world you have to visit a number of websites per day. Instead, why not have one thoughtful, easy to read post per day. Intellectuals could meet at the water cooler and discuss the topic. We&rsquo;d gain exposure to important, interesting ideas all through a simple central location.</p>

<p>I never got very far with my project, but Google is doing a similar thing with <a title="Google 10^100" href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2008/09/project-10100.html" target="_blank">their 10<sup>100</sup> campaign</a>. To celebrate 10 years, Google wants to raise as many helpful ideas as possible. Google and CNN are collaborating, so the star power is there; now we just need some good ideas!</p>
