      <p>I am an experience junkie and a lifelong learner. I love trying new things and learning a variety of topics, so I have a very broad knowledge base. My self-taught methods are extremely effective in learning ~75% of a topic, however, I&rsquo;ve now seen the value of fundamentals.</p>

<p><em><strong>Typing</strong></em>. I&rsquo;m an above average (100 WPM) typist. On the command line I can fly; with chats I&rsquo;m fast. However, whenever I have to type random words (like on a typing test), my speed decreases to ~80WPM. My difficulty is that I learned to type by chatting and playing computer games when I was an early teenager. I went from hunt-and-peck to touch-typing, getting up to a workable ~60 WPM. But I avoided using my pinkies, I crossed the center line (r, t, y, u, d, f, g, h, j, c, v, b, and n were pressed by either hand), and did not use my thumb on the space bar.</p>

<p><em><strong>Guitar</strong></em>. I was above average. At my best I could play virtually anything: Eruption, tons of Metallica, Jimi Hendrix and Stevie Ray Vaughn, classical pieces, and I was on my way to learning Dream Theater. However, as I got into extremely fast pieces my poor picking technique became a limiting factor. When I held my pick, my thumb pointed up instead of down. This made it slightly slower to transition between strings and create harmonics. I also could not transition between strings as quickly as was necessary in the fastest of pieces.</p>

<p>There are other examples, tennis for example, that helped teach me this lesson. I don&rsquo;t play guitar anymore, but my typing has improved dramatically over the years. Since finding that fundamentals matter, I have worked to correct my methods, and I try to start properly. The web is a wonderful place to find information! Videos on YouTube and tutorials on various sites are helping me to right the wrongs and make it all the way to grandmaster in my pursuits :)</p>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/whats-new-ads/">What&#8217;s new? Ads!</a></h1>
      <p>I hope my lovely, intelligent readers do not mind the two new ad panels (at the bottom of individual posts and in the sidebar); RSS readers should not notice any changes. This was a fun technical project that may make me a dollar over about twenty years :)</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s how I added ads to the sidebar and the end of single posts in my WordPress blog. You may be able to do it easily with a plugin, such as one of the <a title="Wordpress Plugins for AdSense" href="http://www.quickonlinetips.com/archives/2006/11/10-best-wordpress-plugins-for-google-adsense/" target="_blank">ten featured in this article</a>, but I chose to do it manually to learn more.</p>

<p>For ease, I used two tabs. In one tab I generated ads and another tab was used to edit pages.</p>

<p><strong>Generating Ads.</strong> Google makes it easy with <a title="Google AdSense" href="https://www.google.com/adsense/" target="_blank">AdSense</a>. You can see your options for ads <a title="AdSense Ad Formats" href="https://www.google.com/adsense/static/en_US/AdFormats.html" target="_blank">here</a>. First, sign up for AdSense then enter the AdSense Setup page, the <a title="Google AdSense Get Ads" href="https://www.google.com/adsense/adsense-products" target="_blank">Get Ads tab</a>. Both my units are AdSense for Content; one Ad Unit and one Link Unit. After choosing the options I wanted, I was given sample code. I copied this code and switched to the other tab.</p>

<p><strong>Editing Pages.</strong> First, get to the Theme Editor:</p>

<ul>
<li>Log into the administrative panel.</li>
<li>Click the <em>Design</em> tab</li>
<li>Click the <em>Theme Editor</em></li>
</ul>


<p>I put the banner ad at the bottom of the single post. To do so I copied the generated code then performed these steps:</p>

<ul>
<li>Selected <em>Single Post (single.php)</em></li>
<li>Pasted the following code above the line &ldquo;&lt;?php get_footer(); ?&gt;&rdquo;:</li>
</ul>


<blockquote>&lt;!&#8212; Ad support. Added by Seth Holloway on Jan 9, 2009 &#8212;&gt;
&lt;div id=&#8221;ads&#8221;&gt;
&lt;script type=&#8221;text/javascript&#8221;&gt;&lt;!&#8211;
google_ad_client = &#8220;pub-2003017988956692&#8221;;
/* 728x90, created 1/8/09 */
google_ad_slot = &#8220;5798236936&#8221;;
google_ad_width = 728;
google_ad_height = 90;
//&#8211;&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script type=&#8221;text/javascript&#8221;
src=&#8221;http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js&#8221;&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</blockquote>


<p>For the sake of looks, I then needed to edit the stylesheet in the following manner:</p>

<ul>
<li>Selected the <em>Stylesheet (style.css)</em></li>
<li>Added this to the code:</li>
</ul>


<blockquote>/* Ad support. Added by Seth Holloway on Jan 9, 2009 */
#ads {
text-align: center;
}</blockquote>


<p>I then generated the sidebar link unit, copied the code, and followed these steps:</p>

<ul>
<li>Selected the <em>Sidebar (sidebar.php)</em></li>
<li>Pasted the generated ad unit to the code above the final &ldquo;&lt;/ul&gt;&rdquo;:</li>
</ul>


<blockquote>&lt;!&#8212; Ad support. Added by Seth Holloway on Jan 9, 2009 &#8212;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;script type=&#8221;text/javascript&#8221;&gt;&lt;!&#8211;
google_ad_client = &#8220;pub-2003017988956692&#8221;;
/* 120x90, created 1/8/09 */
google_ad_slot = &#8220;2887058896&#8221;;
google_ad_width = 120;
google_ad_height = 90;
//&#8211;&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script type=&#8221;text/javascript&#8221;
src=&#8221;http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js&#8221;&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;</blockquote>


<p>And voila! We now have two unobtrusive ads on sethholloway.com.</p>

<p>Later, I would like improve the relevance of the ads and to add Digg, Reddit, and Sharethis buttons.</p>

<p>Any tips for items missing from the blog? Did you notice the ads? Do you hate them?</p>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/why-not-make-use-of-loading-screens/">Why not make use of loading screens?</a></h1>
      <p>I&rsquo;ve seen a lot of loading screens recently: in video games, movies, TV shows, cable box resets, iPod power ons, etc. Most are effective yet bland&mdash;a logo and a progress bar. These brief moments break my attention, but do not offer enough time for me to switch context and do something else. Producers and developers could use this time to educate and inform users while simultaneously keeping people engaged. Watching <a title="IMDB: Once" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0907657/" target="_blank">Once</a>? You&rsquo;ll get to read a blurb about the star, <a title="Wikipedia: Glen Hansard" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glen_Hansard" target="_blank">Glen Hansard</a>. Playing World of Warcraft? Read the storyline for the zone you&rsquo;re entering while you wait!</p>

<p>Taking the idea a step further, a platform could allow for loading screen customizations. Imagine if your iPhone had a common thread across all applications! With the aggregate time you could read a book, polish your vocab, increase reaction speeds, read the latest headlines, learn a language, or anything else that can be chunked into simple, discrete pieces! I&rsquo;d love to get a couple lines of Atlas Shrugged in every loading screen. It&rsquo;s not the fastest way to read a book, but I&rsquo;d get through it (eventually :))!</p>

<p>The code necessary to change the loading screens should be easy: add a variable to track the message number and modify the load screen to accept a variable corresponding to the message number; then increment the message number every time you display a load screen.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve seen the idea partially in action; for example, while loading a song in Rock Band, trivia is displayed. The problem is that the pool of messages is very slim and never updated. The platforms for this game (PS3, Xbox360, and Wii) are all Internet-enabled so it should be possible to periodically update or replace the stash of messages.</p>

<p>Another (somewhat) similar service, <a title="Daily Lit Dot Com" href="http://www.dailylit.com/" target="_blank">Daily Lit</a>, allows you to read books in email messages or RSS feeds. Daily Lit provides a proof-of-concept demonstrating first, that it is possible and second, that people want this form of entertainment.</p>

<p>What do you think? Would you use this service? What would you want in your loading screens?</p>

      <p>I love architecture and green building! I&rsquo;m not as well-informed as I should be, but green homes are an area I would love to explore later in life. One of the best ideas I&rsquo;ve seen is the <a title="Wikipedia: Passive House" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_house" target="_blank">passive house</a> (Passivhaus). Passive homes seek to retain the home&rsquo;s heat with little or no extra energy usage. They achieve the effect by combining several features, notably superinsulation, a special airflow system, and optimized floorplans.</p>

<p>The NY Times has a nice <a title="Low heating bills and a comfortable temperate" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/27/world/europe/27house.html?_r=1" target="_blank">article on passively heated homes</a> and a family living in one in Germany. Germany is important to the tale because they are pioneering the practice, and many of the worlds 15,000 passive houses are in Germany. Unfortunately, America is slow to adopt similar practices. One explanation is America&rsquo;s population center in warmer-weather climates. Because the passive house is designed to retain heat, it would probably not deliver a desirable effect in the summer in Austin :)</p>

<p>America&rsquo;s green building code, the <a title="Wikipedia: LEED" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leadership_in_Energy_and_Environmental_Design" target="_blank">Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED)</a> standard, is lagging behind in achieving energy independence. (More information can be found at the <a title="USGBC LEED Standard" href="http://www.usgbc.org/DisplayPage.aspx?CategoryID=19">US Green Building Council site</a>.) LEED is more about using reusable supplies than it is about living off the grid. In any case, the  idea and innovation in the passive house brings me joy!</p>

<p>What do you think? Would you live in a Passivhaus? Is it worth an additional 5% upfront in order to never pay another utility bill?</p>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/be-important-to-your-friends/">Be important to your friends</a></h1>
      <p>I was reluctant to post about this because it is depressing, but it is also very important. You should strive to be important to your friends, to be remembered favorably.</p>

<p>It was nine years ago today that my mother called to tell me about a bus crash in Colorado. I was 17 and shrugged off the bus crash; &ldquo;who cares?&rdquo; I thought. An hour later I heard a knock on the door. I went downstairs, opened the door, and found three of my friends hanging their heads. As they raised their chins to look at me I noticed puffy eyes. One quietly said, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s dead. Chris is dead.&rdquo; I froze in an overwhelming rush or emotions and quickly started bawling. We all comforted one another, and after a minute I calmed down enough to thank them for telling me. We then drove to a mutual friend&rsquo;s house and suffered together.</p>

<p>Chris Scarberry, one of my best friends, had <a title="Local news coverage" href="http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4191/is_/ai_n9963337" target="_blank">died in a terrible bus accident</a> <a href="http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-67430667.html" target="_blank">that killed three people</a>. All this just days before Christmas after a wonderful ski trip. Needless to say, I did not have a merry Christmas. The young punk in me was humbled. The flippant &ldquo;who cares?&rdquo; came back to bite me. I cared. I cared a lot. I was depressed for months. I struggled to find meaning. I still do. It was terrible and unfair.</p>

<p>Mortality hit me and I realized I had to make life count. I also saw what it meant to be important to your friends. Relationships make life worth living. Chris was a great person and a great friend; he&rsquo;s been very influential in my life. The memory of Chris lives on in me as I follow the path he and I were on together.</p>

<p>Are you the kind of friend that someone would write about nine years later?</p>

<p>Recently I came across a link to <a title="Type Analyzer" href="http://www.typealyzer.com/index.php?lang=en" target="_blank">Type Analyzer</a>, a website that will analyze the text of a webpage and tell you what <a title="Wikipedia: Myers-Briggs" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers-Briggs_Type_Indicator" target="_blank">Myers-Briggs</a> category it falls into. After analyzing my blog, Type Analyzer concluded that I was INTP. Recently, <a title="Seth Holloway: Personality Type" href="http://sethholloway.com/blog/?p=83" target="_blank">a personal inventory yielded ENTP</a>, so I guess Type Analyzer works pretty well. If you don&rsquo;t remember, <strong>E</strong> stands for extrovert and <strong>I</strong> for introvert. The constants are N (intuitive), T (thinker), and P (perceiver). Here&rsquo;s their report verbatim:</p>

<h2>INTP - The Thinkers</h2>


<div style="float: left;"><img title="INTP" src="http://www.typealyzer.com/images/INTP.gif" alt="" /></div>


<p>The logical and analytical type. They are espescially attuned to difficult creative and intellectual challenges and always look for something more complex to dig into. They are great at finding subtle connections between things and imagine far-reaching implications.</p>

<p>They enjoy working with complex things using a lot of concepts and imaginative models of reality. Since they are not very good at seeing and understanding the needs of other people, they might come across as arrogant, impatient and insensitive to people that need some time to understand what they are talking about.</p>

      <p>This week I found an old friend, Dave Hoyt, on facebook. Dave was a great inspiration to my young mind; he was smart, well-read, intellectual, and a great debater. It&rsquo;s been ~8 years since we last hung out and I&rsquo;m proud to say we&rsquo;d still get along.</p>

<p>With introductions aside I&rsquo;d like to direct you to Dave&rsquo;s premier piece of journalism: <a title="Dave Hoyt: Bailout Redux" href="http://www.thecypresstimes.com/article.cfm?articleID=19576" target="_blank">Bailout Redux</a> in <a title="The Cypress Times online" href="http://www.thecypresstimes.com/index.cfm" target="_blank">The Cypress Times</a>. The article is nicely written; it covers a range of topics around the recent economic woes, the disconnect between the citizenry and the rulers, and the <a title="Michael Boatright dot Com" href="http://michaelboatright.com/?p=40" target="_blank">duty of voters</a>&mdash;all in characteristically catchy prose. I encourage you to check it out. Here&rsquo;s a taste: &ldquo;In the current economy, optimism may be the commodity most demanded and least supplied. Peddlers in optimism should do well.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>The cost of owning a car is made up of insurance plus fuel plus maintenance plus registration and inspection. The fixed costs alone make a car cost over $1 a day!</p>

<p>Hmm&hellip;</p>

<p>This is something that I realized after we became a two-car household. Public transportation costs about the same if you buy single fares. However, some organizations work out deals for their constituents to ride free (UT for example). Also, anyone can buy a bus pass that reduces the costs significantly.</p>

<p>Paying over $1 a day for something I don&rsquo;t use is silly, but I&rsquo;m not ready to give up the other car.</p>
