      <p>I love architecture and green building! I&rsquo;m not as well-informed as I should be, but green homes are an area I would love to explore later in life. One of the best ideas I&rsquo;ve seen is the <a title="Wikipedia: Passive House" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_house" target="_blank">passive house</a> (Passivhaus). Passive homes seek to retain the home&rsquo;s heat with little or no extra energy usage. They achieve the effect by combining several features, notably superinsulation, a special airflow system, and optimized floorplans.</p>

<p>The NY Times has a nice <a title="Low heating bills and a comfortable temperate" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/27/world/europe/27house.html?_r=1" target="_blank">article on passively heated homes</a> and a family living in one in Germany. Germany is important to the tale because they are pioneering the practice, and many of the worlds 15,000 passive houses are in Germany. Unfortunately, America is slow to adopt similar practices. One explanation is America&rsquo;s population center in warmer-weather climates. Because the passive house is designed to retain heat, it would probably not deliver a desirable effect in the summer in Austin :)</p>

<p>America&rsquo;s green building code, the <a title="Wikipedia: LEED" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leadership_in_Energy_and_Environmental_Design" target="_blank">Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED)</a> standard, is lagging behind in achieving energy independence. (More information can be found at the <a title="USGBC LEED Standard" href="http://www.usgbc.org/DisplayPage.aspx?CategoryID=19">US Green Building Council site</a>.) LEED is more about using reusable supplies than it is about living off the grid. In any case, theÂ  idea and innovation in the passive house brings me joy!</p>

<p>What do you think? Would you live in a Passivhaus? Is it worth an additional 5% upfront in order to never pay another utility bill?</p>

      <p>I was reluctant to post about this because it is depressing, but it is also very important. You should strive to be important to your friends, to be remembered favorably.</p>

<p>It was nine years ago today that my mother called to tell me about a bus crash in Colorado. I was 17 and shrugged off the bus crash; &ldquo;who cares?&rdquo; I thought. An hour later I heard a knock on the door. I went downstairs, opened the door, and found three of my friends hanging their heads. As they raised their chins to look at me I noticed puffy eyes. One quietly said, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s dead. Chris is dead.&rdquo; I froze in an overwhelming rush or emotions and quickly started bawling. We all comforted one another, and after a minute I calmed down enough to thank them for telling me. We then drove to a mutual friend&rsquo;s house and suffered together.</p>

<p>Chris Scarberry, one of my best friends, had <a title="Local news coverage" href="http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4191/is_/ai_n9963337" target="_blank">died in a terrible bus accident</a> <a href="http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-67430667.html" target="_blank">that killed three people</a>. All this just days before Christmas after a wonderful ski trip. Needless to say, I did not have a merry Christmas. The young punk in me was humbled. The flippant &ldquo;who cares?&rdquo; came back to bite me. I cared. I cared a lot. I was depressed for months. I struggled to find meaning. I still do. It was terrible and unfair.</p>

<p>Mortality hit me and I realized I had to make life count. I also saw what it meant to be important to your friends. Relationships make life worth living. Chris was a great person and a great friend; he&rsquo;s been very influential in my life. The memory of Chris lives on in me as I follow the path he and I were on together.</p>

<p>Are you the kind of friend that someone would write about nine years later?</p>

<p>Recently I came across a link to <a title="Type Analyzer" href="http://www.typealyzer.com/index.php?lang=en" target="_blank">Type Analyzer</a>, a website that will analyze the text of a webpage and tell you what <a title="Wikipedia: Myers-Briggs" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers-Briggs_Type_Indicator" target="_blank">Myers-Briggs</a> category it falls into. After analyzing my blog, Type Analyzer concluded that I was INTP. Recently, <a title="Seth Holloway: Personality Type" href="http://sethholloway.com/blog/?p=83" target="_blank">a personal inventory yielded ENTP</a>, so I guess Type Analyzer works pretty well. If you don&rsquo;t remember, <strong>E</strong> stands for extrovert and <strong>I</strong> for introvert. The constants are N (intuitive), T (thinker), and P (perceiver). Here&rsquo;s their report verbatim:</p>

<h2>INTP - The Thinkers</h2>


<div style="float: left;"><img title="INTP" src="http://www.typealyzer.com/images/INTP.gif" alt="" /></div>


<p>The logical and analytical type. They are espescially attuned to difficult creative and intellectual challenges and always look for something more complex to dig into. They are great at finding subtle connections between things and imagine far-reaching implications.</p>

<p>They enjoy working with complex things using a lot of concepts and imaginative models of reality. Since they are not very good at seeing and understanding the needs of other people, they might come across as arrogant, impatient and insensitive to people that need some time to understand what they are talking about.</p>

<p>What personality type are you? What about your website?</p>

      <p>This week I found an old friend, Dave Hoyt, on facebook. Dave was a great inspiration to my young mind; he was smart, well-read, intellectual, and a great debater. It&rsquo;s been ~8 years since we last hung out and I&rsquo;m proud to say we&rsquo;d still get along.</p>

<p>With introductions aside I&rsquo;d like to direct you to Dave&rsquo;s premier piece of journalism: <a title="Dave Hoyt: Bailout Redux" href="http://www.thecypresstimes.com/article.cfm?articleID=19576" target="_blank">Bailout Redux</a> in <a title="The Cypress Times online" href="http://www.thecypresstimes.com/index.cfm" target="_blank">The Cypress Times</a>. The article is nicely written; it covers a range of topics around the recent economic woes, the disconnect between the citizenry and the rulers, and the <a title="Michael Boatright dot Com" href="http://michaelboatright.com/?p=40" target="_blank">duty of voters</a>&mdash;all in characteristically catchy prose. I encourage you to check it out. Here&rsquo;s a taste: &ldquo;In the current economy, optimism may be the commodity most demanded and least supplied. Peddlers in optimism should do well.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>The cost of owning a car is made up of insurance plus fuel plus maintenance plus registration and inspection. The fixed costs alone make a car cost over $1 a day!</p>

<p>Hmm&hellip;</p>

<p>This is something that I realized after we became a two-car household. Public transportation costs about the same if you buy single fares. However, some organizations work out deals for their constituents to ride free (UT for example). Also, anyone can buy a bus pass that reduces the costs significantly.</p>

<p>Paying over $1 a day for something I don&rsquo;t use is silly, but I&rsquo;m not ready to give up the other car.</p>

      <p>Technologists affect the world tremendously, but America does not value the contribution nearly as much as they do pop stars and athletes. We must change this! If technologists were more prominent, students would have a wider range of role models and education would be taken more seriously.</p>

<p>In an effort to give worthwhile technologists the spotlight, I&rsquo;d like to share one of my favorite technology researchers: <a title="Seth Copen Goldstein" href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~seth/" target="_blank">Seth Goldstein</a>, professor at CMU. Beyond having an awesome first name, Dr. Goldstein is working on world-changing, futuristic research: <a title="Wikipedia: Claytronics" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claytronics" target="_blank">Claytronics</a>. Claytronics is a form of <a title="Wikipedia: Programmable Matter" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmable_matter" target="_blank">programmable matter</a>. composed of claytronics atoms, catoms. Catoms are tiny, autonomous sensors that, together, create emergent behavior. The end goal of Claytronics is to allow pario&mdash;a new media that recreates three-dimensional data (just as a radio recreates sound and TV recreates video).</p>

<p>Claytronics is the talk of the town, getting featured on the <a title="Claytronics on CMU" href="http://www.cmu.edu/corporate/news/2007/features/claytronics.shtml" target="_blank">CMU site</a>, <a title="Clatronics in Make" href="http://blog.makezine.com/archive/2008/02/claytronics_nanoscale_rob.html" target="_blank">Make Magazine</a>, <a title="Clatronics on robots.net" href="http://robots.net/article/1530.html" target="_blank">Robots.net</a>, and <a title="Claytronics on WorldChangingBlog" href="http://www.worldchanging.com/archives/002885.html" target="_blank">WorldChanging.com</a>. CNN boldly claimed that <a title="Claytronics on CNN" href="http://money.cnn.com/magazines/business2/business2_archive/2007/05/01/8405653/index.htm" target="_blank">Claytronics is the true next-generation of robotics</a>. These articles are fairly shallow, so I encourage you to read <a title="Claytronics on Google Scholar" href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=claytronic" target="_blank">scholarly articles about Claytronics</a>.</p>

<p>Still confused? Here&rsquo;s a video of a meeting that uses Claytronics to view and dynamically alter a 3D model in real-time.</p>

<object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="425" height="344" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/bcaqzOUv2Ao&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="344" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/bcaqzOUv2Ao&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object>


<p>They are not there yet. Recent progress looks more like this:</p>

<object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="425" height="344" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/fj2v0HcoBr0&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="344" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/fj2v0HcoBr0&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object>


<p>Three catoms are aligning themselves. Currently, manufacturing technologies do not exist to create nanobots. Goldstein sees three distinct periods from now until Claytronics realization: macro, micro, and nano. The macrobots, as seen in the above video, are large and locomote using magnets. Because of their weight and relatively weak attractive forces (magnetic), the catoms can only move in two dimensions. However, as the catoms shrink they will reduce their weight sharply and be able to use other forces to move. Nanobots may work more like this:</p>

<object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="425" height="344" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/qa2aAun16n0&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="344" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/qa2aAun16n0&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object>


<p>The work is on-going. The vision is clear and we are progressing nicely. Claytronics provides an excellent motivating application example for research into manufacturing, communications, robotics, AI, and more. I look forward to a world where pario is a reality. Thanks to a technology star, Seth Goldstein, we will know that world!</p>

      <p>I enjoy simple tasks that have big rewards&mdash;work smarter, not harder. For example, <a title="Seth Holloway: A Smile is Free" href="http://sethholloway.com/blog/?p=386" target="_blank">smile more</a> :)</p>

<p>Another way to be a good person and get noticed (without dramatically altering your way of life) is to leave situations equal to or better than when you found them. Public restrooms would be so much more pleasant if people left them in at least the same state as when they entered. Lift the seat when appropriate; turn off the water&mdash;even if you did not turn it on; compact the trash a little with your paper towel; pick up that piece of trash when you&rsquo;re on the way to the dumpster.</p>

<p>The adage holds for other situations, not just throwing away trash. Looking at someone&rsquo;s code? Add comments when you figure out the algorithm. If someone asks you for help, take a moment to provide a thorough answer or suggestions on where to find the information. Reply to forums if you stumble upon an unanswered question.</p>

<p>Leaving a situation better than you found it is easy, right, and worthwhile. Take the extra moment and help make the world a better place!</p>

<p><em>EDIT</em> 1) Took &ldquo;l&rdquo; out of &ldquo;waterl&rdquo; in second paragraph. Thanks <a title="You know you like it" href="http://michaelboatright.com" target="_blank">Mike</a>! 2) Corrected &ldquo;wortwhile&rdquo; in the paragraph above. Thanks Eddie!</p>
