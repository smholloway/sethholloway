      <p>After my last Usability course this semester a designer/peer, <a title="Andrea Richeson" href="http://andrearicheson.org/wordpress/" target="_blank">Andrea Richeson</a>, were chatting. She asked me if the course had changed the way I think about designers. I did not have a good answer at the time because I fancy myself a bit of a designer: I&rsquo;ve created several websites (<a title="Mobile and Pervasive Computing @ UT" href="http://mpc.ece.utexas.edu/" target="_blank">MPC</a>, <a title="Software Engineering @ UT" href="http://www.edge.utexas.edu/se/" target="_blank">SE</a>, <a title="Students in Software Engineering @ UT" href="http://www.edge.utexas.edu/se/" target="_blank">SSE</a>, <a title="Seth Holloway Dot Com" href="http://www.sethholloway.com/" target="_blank">SethHolloway.com</a>) and I constantly build/tinker in both virtual and physical spaces. Beyond considering myself a programmer and designer, I found usability testing to be an amazingly practical part of creating something for people. The methods are similar to my favorite software development methodology: agile development&ndash;get the requirements, do a small piece, fix what is broken and ensure people like the effort so far, repeat. After some reflection I can say the course did not really change my view on design, it gave me a framework for evaluating and altering design based on user data.</p>

<p>Fresh out of the class with a solid understanding of the art of usability testing, I was taken aback while reading a New York Times <a title="Ping - Design Based on Data" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/10/business/10ping.html" target="_blank">article about a designer who left Google and went to Twitter</a>. He left Google because of their rigid adherence to trusting data. I am confused how a designer could disagree with trusting data. If you do not like this approach, you don&rsquo;t believe in (1) the way they collect data or (2) trusting the users. The article does not explain how Google collects their data nor does it explain the designer&rsquo;s disdain, but from what I read I think Google&rsquo;s approach is perfect.</p>

<p>Google receives millions of unique visitors per day and they are known for changing elements on the page (think of the whimsical, dynamic elements like logo changes and the &ldquo;Feeling Lucky&rdquo; button), so it is not hard to believe that Google would put up different designs of the same page. Now, a fraction of the millions of users sees one design and another fraction sees the other design. From the web server&rsquo;s standpoint, data collection is fairly easy&ndash;especially with AJAX-enabled dynamic pages: just stream events to the server for logging. Later, a human can analyze the data and make decisions. With sample sizes in the thousands, statistical validity is almost guaranteed!</p>

<p>The approach is wonderful: people&rsquo;s behavior determines the best design for the job and the data is collected without the user&rsquo;s knowledge. What&rsquo;s better than getting people&rsquo;s feedback without their knowledge? Hidden camera shows have always exposed wonderful insights, but we can only get at the truth when people let their guard down.</p>

<p>That is how I imagine the data is collected and the approach seems infalible, thus I must conclude that the designer does not believe in trusting users despite the flawless data collection methods. Even outlandish designs can yield positive results. I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;m missing nuances, but I side with Google. I believe in designing based on data because it keeps us moving towards usable, pleasing designs.</p>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/richard-stallmans-mistaken-thinking-on-copyright/">Richard Stallman&#8217;s Mistaken Thinking on Copyright</a></h1>
      <p>Last Friday I had the honor of seeing <a title="Richard Stallman's Home Page" href="http://www.stallman.org/" target="_blank">Richard Stallman</a>, or <a title="Wikipedia: Richard Stallman" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman" target="_blank">rms</a> as he&rsquo;s known in the computer underground, delivering a lecture about copyright in the digital age at UT.</p>

<p>First, a note on his appearance: I was near the back of a 300-person auditorium, but he looked fairly presentable. He has long hair and a ratty beard, but he was dressed in a clean, bright red shirt and slacks. He wore black Velcro shoes which he quickly slid out of. Another interesting visual was his perfectly spherical basketball-sized belly that stretched his shirt tight against his torso. It was truly amazing given his thin arms and legs!</p>

<p>And now onto the intellectual bits&hellip;</p>

<p>Stallman is a big believer in freedom, and he believes that software should be free (as in speech, not as in beer). Rather than referring to price, free software means the user is free to do what they please, namely <a title="Free Software Foundation Definition" href="http://www.fsf.org/about/what-is-free-software" target="_blank">modify and share</a>. Here&rsquo;s the <a title="Free Software" href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html" target="_blank">definition from the horse&rsquo;s mouth</a>:</p>

<blockquote><em>Free software is a matter of the users&#8217; freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software.  More precisely, it refers to four kinds of freedom, for the users of the software: </em>

 * <em>The freedom to run the program, for any purpose (freedom 0).</em>
 * <em>The freedom to study how the program works, and adapt it to your needs (freedom 1). Access to the source code is a precondition       for this. </em>
 * <em>The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor (freedom 2). </em>
 * <em>The freedom to improve the program, and release your improvements (and modified versions in general) to the public, so that the whole community benefits (freedom 3). Access to the source code is a precondition for this.</em>

</blockquote>


<p>His ideas are very extreme&ndash;likely galvanized by having to defend his position for 20+ years. I did not appreciate his call to &ldquo;argue the moral high ground&rdquo; which generally means &ldquo;use emotion instead of logic.&rdquo; To be sure, people make decisions based on emotion rather than logic, but his call-to-arms felt flimsy without proper reasoning to back the argument.</p>

<p>Along the emotional lines, he lividly proclaimed that &lsquo;people who attack sharing are attacking society because sharing forms the bonds of society!&rsquo; &ldquo;Sharing is good&rdquo; he said in a moment that made me conjure kindergarten memories. He also evokes the positive nostalgia of browsing your friend&rsquo;s library and borrowing a book. He mocked the idea of borrowing an e-book and, with the e-book, the entire e-reader that it is bound to. These ideas form the basis of his argument that sharing should continue with digital works.</p>

<p>After ruminating on the subject and discussing it with a few peers, I believe that Stallman had the right information but came to the wrong conclusion. The fundamental issue is sharing. Traditionally, sharing involves physical objects that cannot conform to his four freedoms; with physical objects there is only one copy of an item that cannot be easily replicated. He claims that a physical object is its own source code and the user is free to alter it and share the object. This is the first mistake: digital objects have recipes, blueprints, and materials that are the source code. Software today is a standalone product that you pay for&ndash;as with physical objects, the source will cost you.</p>

<p>Stallman&rsquo;s second mistake comes when he equates the digital analog of sharing physical objects into modifying and distributing new copies. Physical objects can be modified and distributed, but the owner gives up the object (for some period of time) whenever they share. As time passes the item changes hands and wears (nicks, folds, scratches, pen marks, etc). If a user wants access to the physical object again, they have to get it back from the borrower or buy a new version. Stallman is not the only person to make this mistake. Currently, there are only two possibilities with digital work:</p>

<ul>
<li>DRM style: one user per purchase &ndash; no possibility of sharing</li>
<li>Napster style: many users per purchase &ndash; sharing is common</li>
</ul>


<p>We need a third method that truly mirrors traditional sharing. This digital system would allow you to share with your friends without retaining a copy for yourself.</p>

<p>Years ago, the music and motion pictures industries (digital media publishers) that are &ldquo;losing sales&rdquo; to piracy should have created a system that allows users to purchase one copy to do with as they please. A simple solution is to create a central web server that contains all available material. Access is then controlled based on holding the license to the material. If a person wants to share or sell media, the user should give up their license and pass it on. We could make the access control very user-friendly, virtually transparent, while providing ubiquitous access and promoting sales.</p>

<p>Sharing is good. We should foster the bonds of sharing. We should not proliferate copying.</p>

      <p>This week I attended the <a title="PerCom Official Site" href="http://www.percom.org/" target="_blank">IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications</a> in Galveston, TX. I was there to present my paper <a title="Opening Pervasive Computing to the Masses Using SEAP" href="http://mpc.ece.utexas.edu/Papers/TR-UTEDGE-2008-015.pdf" target="_blank">Opening Pervasive Computing to the Masses Using the SEAP Middleware</a>. If you&rsquo;re interested, here are the slides I presented at the <a title="PerWare 2009" href="http://perware.cs.uiuc.edu/" target="_blank">PerWare workshop</a> Monday morning: seap-sethholloway-perware2009.</p>

<p>The conference itself was a good experience: I received a lot of interesting questions and good feedback. The feedback focuses my future work and will help me become a better presenter. <a title="Hubert Needs a Website" href="http://www.csail.mit.edu/people/768" target="_blank">Hubert Pham</a>, a student under Steve Ward at CSAIL, gave a stellar presentation on goal oriented programming. I also met one of Hubert&rsquo;s co-authors, <a title="Justin Mazzola Paluska from CSAIL @ MIT" href="http://www.mit.edu/~jmp/" target="_blank">Justin Mazzola Paluska</a>. Not only are they great researchers, they&rsquo;re cool guys.</p>

<p>Beyond meeting a couple promising peers, I got to meet <a title="Dr. Gregory Abowd of Georgia Tech" href="http://www.gregoryabowd.com/" target="_blank">Dr. Gregory Abowd</a>&ndash;the highlight of the trip. Dr. Abowd is one of my favorite researchers. He gave a very inspirational keynote to open the conference. He is a prince of a man, and I hope to interact with him more in the future.</p>

<p>I was also glad to see Galveston in fair shape. After Hurricane Ike the island was in very bad shape. Although the bulk of the beach is yet to be repaired this spring break the island can host a fair number of tourists. Luckily, there were signs of life outside the plethora of PerCommers.</p>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/the-top-100-modern-books/">The Top 100 (Modern) Books</a></h1>
      <p>The BBC compiled a <a title="BBC Big Read" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/arts/bigread/top100.shtml" target="_blank">list of the 100 most loved books</a>, as voted by Brits. There is a definite slant to modern books; more precisely, books that have been turned into movies. I also found it interested that England&rsquo;s richest female, JK Rowling, is disproportionately listed (four of the seven Harry Potter series in the top 25). Notably absent from the list is iconic libertarian author Ayn Rand whose book, <a title="Ayn Rand Institude: Atlas Shrugged Sales Up" href="http://www.aynrand.org/site/News2?page=NewsArticle&amp;id=22647" target="_blank">Atlas Shrugged, is seeing increased sales recently</a>. Rand fled communist Russia and developed a philosophy that almost perfectly counters the opinions on those she feared; Karl Marx wrote plenty that opposes Rand. Marx and Rand are arguably two of the most influential philosophers of the 20th century (not that the 20th century will be known for philosophy), yet neither is represented.</p>

<p>The <a title="Time: Top 100 Books" href="http://www.time.com/time/2005/100books/the_complete_list.html" target="_blank">Time list</a> (compiled by critics) also ignores Rand. The <a title="Random House's Top 100" href="http://www.randomhouse.com/modernlibrary/100bestnovels.html" target="_blank">Modern Library has two lists</a>, one from critics and one from users. Their critic list does not have Rand, yet their user list contains four Rand books in the top 10! Continuing to look I found that (perhaps) objectivism is more popular amongst men as Rand appears on the <a title="The Art of Manliness: 100 Must-Read Books" href="http://artofmanliness.com/2008/05/14/100-must-read-books-the-essential-mans-library/" target="_blank">100 Must-Read Books in the Essential Man&rsquo;s Library</a>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m really shocked because the dreaded classics appear all over the lists! In several discussions of literature I&rsquo;ve only met one person who enjoyed the classics; my peers all hated the books we slogged through in high school. That&rsquo;s not to say the classics are not important, but I do not relate with the baroque period like I do modern times. My favorite writer, Neal Stephenson, does not appear on these lists, although Snow Crash has topped <a title="Time: Snow Crash as rated by readers" href="http://www.time.com/time/2005/100books/0,24459,snow_crash,00.html" target="_blank">lists of readers&#8217; choice</a>. What&rsquo;s wrong with these lists? Put on your tin foil hats because I think there&rsquo;s a conspiracy!</p>

<p>Each list highlights the problems of sampling human subjects, for example: selection bias, poor controls, and privacy concerns among others. In the end, books are entertainment and entertainment is completely subjective. Do what you like and let me do the same.</p>

<p>What do you think of the lists? Is there one that aligns with your tastes? Do you like the classics? What authors or books are missing?</p>

      <p>I love Google. They represent so many positive ideas about technology and offer an amazing suite of tools. Gmail is fantastic. I adore Google Calendar. Google Scholar is the only site I need for research. Google Reader is the best RSS feed reader on the market. Google Docs works a like a charm and is infinitely handy. I have entrusted my workflow to Google and had positive results. They&rsquo;ve taken over the heavy lifting and ushered in an era of browser-based productivity that I agree with wholeheartedly. I&rsquo;m excited today to use yet another Google server: I added <a title="Google Analytics" href="http://www.google.com/analytics/" target="_blank">Google Analytics</a> to the site :)</p>

<p>In last week&rsquo;s <a title="Randolph Bias' awesome class" href="http://courses.ischool.utexas.edu/Bias_Randolph/2009/Spring/INF385P/" target="_blank">Introduction to Usability course</a> we discussed good and bad websites, and one student selected Google Analytics as a good website. The Analytics page provides all the necessary statistics on your sites traffic including their IP address and corresponding location, the number of unique visitors, and timing. It was characteristically Google: clean, easy to use, and hugely useful. I had no idea the service was free!</p>

<p>Inspired by the class I checked into Google Analytics further and signed up. I added <a href="http://www.sethholloway.com">http://www.sethholloway.com</a> to the service and they generated the necessary javascript&ndash;they even told me where to place it (though I already <a title="Seth Holloway: Learning HTML/CSS" href="http://sethholloway.com/blog/?p=633" target="_blank">knew enough HTML</a> to insert the scripts)</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the generated javascript:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre id="line20">&lt;<span class="start-tag">script</span><span class="attribute-name"> type</span>=<span class="attribute-value">"text/javascript"</span>&gt;
  var gaJsHost = (("https:" == document.location.protocol) ?
                   "https://ssl." : "http://www.");
  document.write(unescape("%3Cscript src='" + gaJsHost +
                          "google-analytics.com/ga.js' 
                          type='text/javascript'%3E%3C/script%3E"));
&lt;/<span class="end-tag">script</span>&gt;
&lt;<span class="start-tag">script</span><span class="attribute-name"> type</span>=<span class="attribute-value">"text/javascript"</span>&gt;
  try {
    var pageTracker = _gat._getTracker("UA-7555904-1");
    pageTracker._trackPageview();
  } catch(err) {}
&lt;/script&gt;</pre>
</blockquote>


<p>And the only change necessary to gather statistics from across the blog is contained in header.php. From your WordPress admin panel click Appearance-&gt;Editor-&gt;Header (header.php). Then locate this bit of code and insert the generated code where I placed the comment below:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre id="line20">&lt;?php if ( is_singular() ) wp_enqueue_script( 'comment-reply' ); ?&gt;

&lt;?php wp_head(); ?&gt;

//PASTE GOOGLE ANALYTICS CODE HERE AND REMOVE THIS LINE

&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;div id="page"&gt;</pre>
</blockquote>


<p>That&rsquo;s it! So simple! So useful! If you haven&rsquo;t already signed up for Google Analytics, do it now. The service is free, incredibly helpful and easy to use; even better, installation will take you less time than heating up that Hot Pocket!</p>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/learning-htmlcss/">Learning HTML/CSS?</a></h1>
      <p>Are you new to HTML/CSS? Knowing the basics of HTML/CSS is extremely useful. Below are a couple options to get started in learning HTML/CSS. There are great resources freely available at <a title="HTML Dog" href="http://htmldog.com/" target="_blank"><a href="http://htmldog.com/">http://htmldog.com/</a></a> and <a title="W3 Schools" href="http://www.w3schools.com/htmL/" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.w3schools.com/htmL/.">http://www.w3schools.com/htmL/.</a></a></p>

<p>So you understand there are tags opened and closed with angled brackets, &ldquo;&lt;&rdquo; and &ldquo;&gt;&rdquo;, now what? To create your site you have two main options:
1) SSH in and poke around. Edit files with your favorite editor (nano, pico, vi, etc.).</p>

<p>2) Modify files locally. This can be done easily two ways:</p>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;">2a) Download the Web Developer Toolbar addon for Firefox: <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/60" target="_blank">https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/60</a> then restart Firefox. Now you can use the toolbar to Edit CSS and Edit <span class="nfakPe">HTML</span> on any page you view. To edit CSS: right click a page-&gt;Web Developer-&gt;CSS-&gt;Edit CSS. To edit <span class="nfakPe">html</span>: right click a page-&gt;Web Developer-&gt;Miscellaneous-&gt;Edit <span class="nfakPe">HTML</span>. If you find a configuration you prefer, press the save button and keep a copy locally. When you&#8217;re satisfied, copy your copy to the server (scp, ftp, WinSSH, etc.).</div>


<div style="margin-left: 40px;">2b) Right click on the web page and choose &#8220;View Page Source&#8221; to get the <span class="nfakPe">html</span> page you&#8217;re currently viewing. For a pure <span class="nfakPe">html</span> page, this will give you everything you need to know. It does not work as well on pages generated by web programming languages (for example, viewing the source of a google page gives you near-nonsense because they&#8217;ve obfuscated the details with their Python generation). This method will work perfectly for the SSE page,  <a href="http://www.edge.utexas.edu/sse/SSE.css" target="_blank">http://www.edge.utexas.edu/sse/</a>. With the <span class="nfakPe">html</span> page in view, you should be able to find a style declaration. In the SSE index.<span class="nfakPe">html</span> you&#8217;ll see</div>


<blockquote>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"> <em>&lt;<span>style</span><span> media</span>=<span>&#8220;screen&#8221; </span><span>title</span>=<span>&#8220;currentStyle&#8221; </span><span>type</span>=<span>&#8220;text/css&#8221;</span>&gt;@import &#8220;SSE.css&#8221;;&lt;/<span>style</span>&gt;</em></span></div></blockquote>


<div style="margin-left: 40px;">So point your browser to the indicated style file; in this case <a href="http://www.edge.utexas.edu/sse/SSE.css" target="_blank">http://www.edge.utexas.edu/sse/SSE.css</a>. You&#8217;ll then have the style files.</div>


<p>Now you&rsquo;re on your way to figuring out the Internet! View and edit your favorite pages or create your own. If you see something you like, view the HTML/CSS and learn! It&rsquo;s quick, easy, and useful. Good luck!</p>

<p>Did I miss something? Was this useful? How did you learn HTML/CSS?</p>

<p>Update: Thanks for the help, Steve and <a title="Lane Holloway" href="http://www.laneholloway.com/" target="_blank">Lane</a>.</p>

      <p>We spend 1/3 of our lives sleeping, so why not enjoy that time? Beyond being a large part of our life, sleep is essential to proper brain function. Sleep affects memory, mood, and physical performance to name a few. Modern scientists recommend 7-8 hours of sleep per night, although before the advent of lights, humans slept 10-12 hours per night.</p>

<p>I was not a believer myself until last summer. I slept on a $400 mattress+box springs, and I planned to continue doing so until several years after the bed rotted into nothingness. However, that plan did not work for my wife. She encouraged me to go try new mattresses, so we did. The difference between the bed I had and the pricier ($800+) beds was remarkably apparent! It took me another couple days of thinking, but finally I decided to invest in restful sleep. (I got a <a title="Tempurpedic dot com" href="http://www.tempurpedic.com/" target="_blank">Tempurpedic</a> if you&rsquo;re wondering.) Since then I have slept much more soundly and been more comfortable.</p>

<p>Hopefully Ive convinced you, or you already know, that sleep is important. However, very few people invest in restful sleep. For instance, a nice bed. Beds are relatively cheap with expensive mattresses still coming in under $5,000. Compare that price to a car which can easily reach six figures&ndash;and you probably spend far less time in your car. I assure you the ROI of restful sleep is huge. A comfortable bed is worth every penny!</p>

<p>Do you believe? Have you upgraded your bed yet? When do you get the most restful sleep? Does the bed make a difference?</p>

      <p>Over the holidays Wired published an article, <a title="Wired: Seven Best Capers of 2008" href="http://blog.wired.com/27bstroke6/2008/12/capers.html" target="_blank">the Seven Best Capers of 2008</a>, that ran down a list of crafty, entertaining schemes that ultimately resulted in the perpetrator getting caught. I encourage you to read the entire article; you&rsquo;ll find that every story involves a digital component. Here&rsquo;s the top rated heist:</p>

<blockquote><span class="capers_hed">The Snohomish Smokescreen</span>
<div class="desc">

In September, a robber disguised as a gardener pepper-sprayed an armored car driver using a pesticide sprayer and ran off with a bag stuffed with $400,000 in cash. When police arrived seconds later, they found the sidewalk crowded with dozens of men decked out in the same attire as the perp: blue shirt, Day-Glo vest, safety mask and glasses. While the cops hacked through a forest of suspects, the real perp fled to a nearby creek and escaped in a waiting inner tube.

Turns out the unwitting decoys had been lured to the crime scene by a Craigslist ad that promised construction work to those showing up in a &#8220;yellow vest, safety goggles, a respirator mask … and, if possible, a blue shirt.&#8221; A month later, following a lead from a homeless man who witnessed the preparation for the Brinks job, police arrested 28-year-old Anthony Curcio fresh from a Las Vegas vacation. Curcio is now charged with &#8220;Interference with commerce by threats or violence,&#8221; because &#8220;Pulling the most awesome robbery ever&#8221; isn&#8217;t listed in the U.S. code.</div></blockquote>


<p>Missing from the list are the scams by Wall Street, car companies, and any other bailout recipient as well as individuals like Bernie Madoff :)</p>

<p>While not as entertaining to watch as the daring <a title="IMDB: Ocean's 11" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0240772/" target="_blank">Ocean&rsquo;s 11</a>, the list helps to highlight how new media (using twitter to create flashmobs, for example) and cybercrime are the way of the future. A realistic movie about any one of these heists would involve a kid at a computer for days on end, slowly accumulating wealth.</p>

<p>Stealing physical items was much easier to catch and prosecute; with modern plots siphoning off fractions of a cent per transaction, we face a brave new world. America has to increase technological infrastructure, educate citizens about risks, and allow greater research into security.</p>

<p>What do you think? Have I misinterpreted? What&rsquo;s the future of crime and high-stake heists? How can we prevent it or at least mitigate the losses?</p>

      <p>An article, <a title="Rejecting the Academic Fast Track" href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2009/01/15/family" target="_blank">Rejecting the Academic Fast Track</a>, was posted January 15 on Inside Higher Ed. The article summarizes a study of over 8,300 graduate students in the University of California (UC) system; the study reveals that fewer graduate students are interested in pursuing tenure track positions at research universities. This is particularly interesting due to the large sample size and the strong academic performance of the UC schools (<a title="Wikipedia: UC" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California" target="_blank">two schools in the top 25 and 8 in the top 100</a>, Berkeley is <a title="UC-Berkeley 2 in CompEngr" href="http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/grad/eng/comp" target="_blank">top 5 in several</a> <a title="UC-Berkeley 2 in EE" href="http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/grad/eng/elec" target="_blank">engineering disciplines</a>, and <a title="Oldie but goodie" href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~landay/school-rankings94.txt" target="_blank">high rankings in law, medicine, and business</a>).</p>

<p>Study participants seem to echo Generation Y&rsquo;s desire to live a well-rounded life full of experiences and relationships (family) which academia does not foster. About 40% of the participants entered the PhD with academia in mind; after being part of the ivory tower the number had dropped ~10%. Roughly a quarter of the female PhDs said they would go into academia. With the number of female professors in the sciences and engineering already disproportionately low, this statistic should concern universities. The majority of those surveyed felt that teaching colleges were more in-line with their goals.</p>

<p>The study points out the issue and provides suggestions on how to alter future-professors&#8217; attitudes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Allow faculty members to shift to part-time status or temporarily elongate timelines over their academic lives without suffering career penalties.</li>
<li>Allow faculty members to take time out temporarily from their academic lives for care-giving and support their return.</li>
<li>Abandon the idea that academic stars are those who move through the ranks very quickly. and embrace the idea that the stars are those who produce the most important or relevant work  faster is not necessarily better.</li>
<li>Embrace the idea that it is fine to have children at any point in the career path because a full array of resources exists to support academic parents.</li>
<li>Challenge the stigma in which having children, particularly for women, is often equated with less seriousness and drive.</li>
</ul>


<p>The suggestions looks surprisingly similar to options in industry. It seems that the economy will change dramatically in the next decade: baby boomers will retire or expire leaving a hole in the workforce; 70% of young people want to work for themselves; the economy has taken a slant to services; Gen Y is collaborative, socially-minded, and entitled&ndash;ideas that go against the grain of current work culture.</p>

<p>What do you think? Is the ivory tower crumbling? Will teaching colleges get the top talent? How will that affect hiring at research universities? Will colleges be run more or less like businesses in the future? How will Gen Y affect the future of academia?</p>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/fundamentals-matter-in-the-end/">Fundamentals matter in the end</a></h1>
      <p>I am an experience junkie and a lifelong learner. I love trying new things and learning a variety of topics, so I have a very broad knowledge base. My self-taught methods are extremely effective in learning ~75% of a topic, however, I&rsquo;ve now seen the value of fundamentals.</p>

<p><em><strong>Typing</strong></em>. I&rsquo;m an above average (100 WPM) typist. On the command line I can fly; with chats I&rsquo;m fast. However, whenever I have to type random words (like on a typing test), my speed decreases to ~80WPM. My difficulty is that I learned to type by chatting and playing computer games when I was an early teenager. I went from hunt-and-peck to touch-typing, getting up to a workable ~60 WPM. But I avoided using my pinkies, I crossed the center line (r, t, y, u, d, f, g, h, j, c, v, b, and n were pressed by either hand), and did not use my thumb on the space bar.</p>

<p><em><strong>Guitar</strong></em>. I was above average. At my best I could play virtually anything: Eruption, tons of Metallica, Jimi Hendrix and Stevie Ray Vaughn, classical pieces, and I was on my way to learning Dream Theater. However, as I got into extremely fast pieces my poor picking technique became a limiting factor. When I held my pick, my thumb pointed up instead of down. This made it slightly slower to transition between strings and create harmonics. I also could not transition between strings as quickly as was necessary in the fastest of pieces.</p>

<p>There are other examples, tennis for example, that helped teach me this lesson. I don&rsquo;t play guitar anymore, but my typing has improved dramatically over the years. Since finding that fundamentals matter, I have worked to correct my methods, and I try to start properly. The web is a wonderful place to find information! Videos on YouTube and tutorials on various sites are helping me to right the wrongs and make it all the way to grandmaster in my pursuits :)</p>
