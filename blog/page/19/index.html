      <p>Phishing is presumably big business (although <a title="Dancho Danchev's analysis of profit in the digital black market" href="http://www.zdnet.com/blog/security/microsoft-study-debunks-profitability-of-the-underground-economy/3522" target="_blank">maybe not</a>). Because email is very cheap to send, phishing has a low barrier for entry. Usually, Gmail&rsquo;s spam filter is so accurate that I don&rsquo;t see the phishing emails, however, recently some Blizzard themed messages have gotten through. I get the impression that the emails are crafted by foreigners who lack the finesse necessary to deceive people&mdash;a good thing, no doubt. As with most pursuits, the devil is in the details. Let me illustrate with the most recent email to pierce Gmail&rsquo;s phishing armor:</p>

<p>I like the use of ® and ™! Those are definitely nice touches. However, Blizzard begins by greeting you with the name on the account. Moving on, the CD key should have dashes. Whoops. Next, we see &ldquo;Battle.n Account &ndash; Or Create at Battle.net Account.&rdquo; Within a few words, they misspell Battle.net and give you the proper spelling. Then there&rsquo;s the gratuitous use of capitalization throughout. Seen here on &ldquo;Account,&rdquo; &ldquo;Or,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Create.&rdquo; Throughout, there are a few small, unprofessional and inconsistent bits, like the lack of carriage return between items 3 and 4. Then &ldquo;CDKey&rdquo; is lacking a space&hellip; Another awesome failure: the &ldquo;Vis<strong><em>t</em></strong>a&rdquo; credit card type! A couple lines lower, the &ldquo;Shipping Tax&rdquo; itemized seems off.</p>

<p>To be fair, if you were expecting a StarCraft email (sadly, the phishers are two weeks late) and gave only  a quick glance, the email could work. It is apparently sent by Blizzard Entertainment! However, digging deeper in the email header we see more incorrect details:</p>

<blockquote>from    Blizzard Entertainment
to  seth@sethholloway.com
date    Wed, Aug 11, 2010 at 8:46 PM
subject Battle.net Account Management
mailed-by   hotmail.com</blockquote>


<p>Mailed by hotmail? Phishy. Details, details!</p>

<p>Also, it&rsquo;s important to hover over links before following them&hellip; This is probably my favorite part: &ldquo;wowsuppor-check-blizzard.com.&rdquo; I guess wowsuppor<strong><em>t</em></strong>-check-blizzard.com was already registered :) And, of course, official Blizzard emails direct you to us.battle.net instead of blizzard.com. Details!</p>

<p>Another detail that reeks of fraud is the use of &ldquo;WoW&rdquo;/&ldquo;wow&rdquo;, which refers to another Blizzard product, World of Warcraft. Account management, StarCraft II, and World of Warcraft blend into one weak attempt at phishing.</p>

<p>I believe that every critique should come with a suggestion, so here&rsquo;s my suggestion: buy a legitimate copy of StarCraft II and copy the official email exactly, changing only the link (from official site to your faked site). Then, replicate their website and direct people to the fake. To Blizzard&rsquo;s credit they do not make copying the page easy because they cleverly use dynamically rendered Ajax elements with obfuscated JavaScript and XSLT. They also have a lot of content and they update the pages regularly. Another idea: direct them to your domain, infect their computer with malware, and quickly forward them to battle.net so they&rsquo;re none the wiser.</p>

<p>If you want to step up to the big leagues, you&rsquo;ll have to concentrate on the details!</p>

  <div class="row-fluid">
    <div class="span12 post-container">
      <h1 class="link"><a href="/rails-3-document-on-error/">Rails 3 document.on error</a></h1>
      <p>I&rsquo;m working through <a title="Agile Web Development with Rails" href="http://pragprog.com/titles/rails4/agile-web-development-with-rails" target="_blank">Agile Web Development with Rails, 4th Edition</a>. Overall, the book is well written&mdash;readable, nice depth and breadth, great example (ecommerce site)&mdash;and I would recommend it highly; however,  Chapter 11, adding Ajax support to the cart, has given me hell.</p>

<p>I spent hours working through the example a couple times, diffing my source against the <a title="Agile Web Development with Rails source code" href="http://pragprog.com/titles/rails4/source_code" target="_blank">source code provided</a>, starting and restarting the server, trying multiple browsers (Safari, Firefox, Chrome), grepping for errors,  and googling. Finally, I arrived at the solution:</p>

<p>To remedy this problem, I updated my public/javascripts/prototype.js file from the <a href="http://www.prototypejs.org/download" target="_blank">prototype download page</a>. At the time of writing, that was <a href="http://prototypejs.org/assets/2010/5/13/prototype.js" target="_blank"><a href="http://prototypejs.org/assets/2010/5/13/prototype.js">http://prototypejs.org/assets/2010/5/13/prototype.js</a></a></p>

<p><strong>Debugging</strong></p>

<p>Here are the steps I followed to track down the problem.</p>

<p>First, I noticed that the page was refreshing everytime I pressed an &ldquo;Add to Cart&rdquo; button. I made sure the necessary files were in place and the javascript input was defined for the create method I was Ajaxifying. To ensure the button was properly defined, I viewed source and ensured the element had an attribute <em>data-remote=&ldquo;true&rdquo;.</em> Despite proper HTML and Ruby, the development.log showed that I was still retrieving the page as HTML instead of JavaScript</p>

<blockquote>Started POST &#8220;/line_items?product_id=3&#8221; for 127.0.0.1 at Sun Jul 18 21:06:41 -0500 2010
Processing by LineItemsController#create as HTML
Parameters: {&#8220;product_id&#8221;=&gt;&#8221;3&#8221;, &#8220;authenticity_token&#8221;=&gt;&#8221;Dsv044fqfo7H46jLYx3e6qnbCgqk3Tcoij6pqbOQZx4=&#8221;}</blockquote>


<p>So I checked the browser errors. Firefox showed</p>

<blockquote>Error: document.on is not a function
Source File: http://localhost:3000/javascripts/rails.js?1277734011
Line: 136</blockquote>


<p>Inspecting the element in Chrome I saw</p>

<blockquote>Uncaught TypeError: Object #&lt;an HTMLDocument&gt; has no method &#8216;on&#8217;</blockquote>


<p>Looking at the rails.js file, line 136, we see</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>  document.on("click", "*[data-confirm]", function(event, element) {
    var message = element.readAttribute('data-confirm');
    if (!confirm(message)) event.stop();
  });</pre>
</blockquote>


<p>Between the errors and the rails.js file, we see that none of the included JavaScript files nor the browser defined the method. A new <a title="Rails 3 Patch" href="https://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8994/tickets/5109-make-prototypejs-compatible-with-railsjs-for-30" target="_blank">Rails 3 patch</a> will upgrade prototype from 1.6.1 to 1.7rc2, so future generations will not experience this fun.</p>

      <p>I&rsquo;ve been enjoying the World Cup for the past three weeks&mdash;while still getting all of my work done, of course. One thing that has been really neat is seeing the diverse cultures communicating. I imagine the players and referees could play without words (we&rsquo;ll let them keep whistles and hand-signs), but very frequently players verbally plead for calls and the ref explicitly announces situations to players. The on-field interactions seem to be in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language">English</a>.</p>

<p>When Paraguay, coached by an Argentinian, <a href="http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/matches/round=249718/match=300061506/index.html">played</a> Spain, coached by a Spaniard, they were officiated by a Guatemalan, Costa Rican, Honduran, and Mexican; I&rsquo;d guess everyone spoke Spanish. But the situation gets more complicated if we look at when Paraguay (native Spanish speakers) <a href="http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/matches/round=249717/match=300061497/index.html">played</a> Japan (native Japanese speakers) with refs from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium">Belgium</a> (official languages are Dutch, French, and German). My lip-reading skills are admittedly amateur, but I perceived English. This has been the case throughout the tournament. Now, I&rsquo;m glad that I focused on furthering my English skills instead of futilely learning a foreign language because everyone speaks English. The World Cup taught me so :&ndash;)</p>

<p>So, when and how are players from all of the world learning English well enough to communicate with other similarly diverse English-speakers? When did this start? Because <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diego_Maradona">Maradona</a>, an old school footballer, interviews in Spanish using a translator.</p>

      <p>A friend of mine sent me a video of Dustin Carter, a wrestling badass. Check out his workout:</p>

<p>Despite having no arms and no legs  (a rare infection forced him to have both arms and legs amputated), Dustin has an awesome record. It&rsquo;s really inspirational; as one of the <a href="http://www.flowrestling.org">Flowrestling</a> comments says, &ldquo;No excuses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s also a documentary on him. Here&rsquo;s a teaser:</p>

<object width="480" height="385"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/qmicID3JwsE&hl=en_US&fs=1&"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/qmicID3JwsE&hl=en_US&fs=1&" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="480" height="385"></embed></object>


<p>Even Sports Illustrated has picked up on him <a href="http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/multimedia/photo_gallery/0804/wrestling.dustin.carter/content.1.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>I must admit, I find the lives of differently abled people quite interesting, and Dustin is no exception. It&rsquo;s amazing that he has adapted and succeeded. Well done, Dustin Carter! Keep wrestling!</p>

      <p>Yesterday my grandmother, Viola Holloway, passed away after 89 fruitful years. While this is incredibly painful for me, her passing is not all sad; given her condition this semester, I can say she&rsquo;s in a  better place now.</p>

<p>Viola was an awesome grandma, and I&rsquo;m going to miss her tremendously. She always had treats and encouraging words for me! I will cherish the memories and try to be as loving and supportive of my progeny as she was of hers.</p>

<p>Exercise. Be happy. Live simply. Viola had it right.</p>

      <p>After birthing a super cute baby boy, a good friend, Tahra, started a business selling handcrafted baby items (with another friend in a similar situation, Katie). The business, <a title="Petite Pensieri" href="http://www.etsy.com/shop/PetitePensieri" target="_blank">Petite Pensieri</a>, is very inspiring; I have been impressed by so many elements! Tahra and Katie have shown tremendous initiative and their products are high-quality and useful.</p>

<p>From a technological standpoint, <a title="Etsy" href="http://www.etsy.com/" target="_blank">Etsy</a> offers an amazing platform for handmade items. The service allows you to quickly and easily list items for sale. <a title="Etsy Fees" href="http://www.etsy.com/fees.php" target="_blank">Etsy&rsquo;s fees</a> are quite reasonble: &ldquo;It costs 20 cents to list an item for four months. When your item sells,  you’ll pay a 3.5% transaction fee.&rdquo; <a title="Shopify" href="http://www.shopify.com/" target="_blank">Shopify</a> is a similar idea: you create an online storefront and they manage everything else for a fee. The monthly <a title="Shopify: Fees" href="https://app.shopify.com/services/signup" target="_blank">cost of Shopify</a> ranges from $24 (for 100 products and a 2% transaction fee) to $699 per month (for 50,000 products and no transaction fee), so the two sites addresses slightly different needs. With some quick math I&rsquo;d say Etsy is cheaper up to $1,600 worth of sales a month (24+0.02<em>x = 0.035</em>x &ndash;&gt; 24 = 0.015*x &ndash;&gt; 1600 = x). To be fair, Shopify wins if, for example, you want custom domain names and landing pages or selling goods that don&rsquo;t qualify for Etsy.</p>

<p>Tonight, Tahra and Katie will be offering their awesome wares at <a title="About.com: First Thursday in Austin" href="http://austin.about.com/od/eventsandactivities/a/first_thursday_austin.htm" target="_blank">First Thursday</a>. If you&rsquo;re around, go enjoy the experience and keep Austin weird (or at least local ;&ndash;))! If you&rsquo;re going to a baby shower, buy something nice from <a title="Petite Pensieri" href="http://www.etsy.com/shop/PetitePensieri" target="_blank">Petite Pensieri</a> and the baby will thank you later!</p>

      <p>Over the weekend I published <a title="Seth Holloway Timeline Resume" href="http://www.sethholloway.com/timelineResume.html" target="_blank">my resume as a timeline</a>. With the standard text-based resume I found it hard to show my simultaneous jobs (for example, in Spring 2010 I was pursuing my PhD, working part-time at IBM, researching under Christine, teaching/grading Project Management, keeping up the lab&rsquo;s computing infrastructure, supervising Michael Hanna, assisting a couple companies with their computing needs, and actively participating in two organizations). The timeline allows me to show these jobs at once rather than tacitly asking the reader to juggle all the &ldquo;X &ndash; Present&rdquo; entries under multiple headings.</p>

<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-1011" title="TimelineResume" src="/images/TimelineResume-300x120.png" alt="Seth Holloway's timeline resume" width="300" height="120" /></p>

<p>It was a great project with HTML/CSS and JavaScript! I was inspired  by other great infographics, but after I had published the resume, I  found there were some other timeline resumes I could have used as a  guide. In any case, I like mine and I hope you do too!</p>

<p>Do you see any improvements I could make? Anything that is unclear or  hard to use?</p>

      <p>I&rsquo;ve long been in the habit of spelling my last name for people after I tell them. Some people reply almost indignantly, &ldquo;How else would you spell it?!&rdquo; Well, I set up my <a title="Google Webmaster Tools" href="https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/home?hl=en" target="_blank">Google Webmaster tools</a> and people are stumbling upon the site from the query &ldquo;<a title="Seth Holloway Dot Com" href="http://www.sethholloway.com/" target="_blank">seth halloway</a>.&rdquo; Perhaps it&rsquo;s time to publish all the common misspellings of my name:</p>

<ul>
<li><a title="Seth Holloway Dot Com" href="http://www.sethholloway.com/" target="_blank">seth holloway</a></li>
<li><a title="Seth Holloway Dot Com" href="http://www.sethholloway.com/" target="_blank">seth halloway</a></li>
<li><a title="Seth Holloway Dot Com" href="http://www.sethholloway.com/" target="_blank">seth hallaway</a></li>
<li><a title="Seth Holloway Dot Com" href="http://www.sethholloway.com/" target="_blank">seth hollaway</a></li>
</ul>


<p>At my first grade graduation, the principal beckoned me across the stage by calling &ldquo;<a title="Seth Holloway Dot Com" href="http://www.sethholloway.com/" target="_blank">seeth holloway</a>&rdquo; and I&rsquo;ve been called &ldquo;<a title="Seth Holloway Dot Com" href="http://www.sethholloway.com/" target="_blank">sean holloway</a>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<a title="Seth Holloway Dot Com" href="http://www.sethholloway.com/" target="_blank">scott holloway</a>!&rdquo; After attending a diverse graduate program, I have heard some amazing mispronounciations and I know that I have nothing to complain about :)</p>

      <p>One day I was enjoying a balmy afternoon at <a title="Mozart's Coffee Roasters" href="http://www.mozartscoffee.com/" target="_blank">Mozart&rsquo;s</a> with my wife. While it was not my goal to eavesdrop, I overheard two women talking about finding jobs&mdash;a common topic these days. The profound bit that I picked up on was an analogy: finding jobs is like spinning plates. If you apply too much or too little force to a plate, the plate will fall. I think this simple idea applies to all facets of life; once again, moderation is a virtue.</p>
