      <p>The government has meddled far too long by regulating the electromagnetic spectrum! TV broadcasters were given premium real estate on the spectrum; now that TV has gone digital, the spectrum should be freed. The physical properties of the &ldquo;white spaces&rdquo; make it an ideal candidate for wireless innovation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Just as Wi-Fi sparked a revolution in the way we connect to the web, freeing the &#8220;white space&rdquo; airwaves could help unleash a new wave of technological innovation, create jobs, and boost our economy.</em>&#8221;</p>

      <p>Back in the day I dabbled with video game automation. In fact, it was the subject of my senior design project. I started macroing (playing unattended) in the first MMORPG I ever played, Ultima Online. There have been bots for every game since. Some bots are specific while others are more generalized. I&rsquo;ve played around with system automation software and specific programs.</p>

<p>By far the most sophisticated I&rsquo;ve seen was designed for World of Warcraft (WoW). WoWGlider, or just Glider, as it was called provided functionality for virtually everything in the game. The really savvy guys combined their own homegrown programs, addons, and Glider to gain lots of money and levels. These virtual goods are worth a ton. And game makers pretend to hate it. Botters get can get disconnected, killed, have their items stripped, and worst, banned (i.e. the account is deleted).</p>

<p>But the most aggressive actions were taken by Blizzard, maker of some of the most popular games ever (Diablo I &amp; II, Starcraft, Warcraft 1-3). I suppose the sophistication of Glider warranted special care, so Blizzard filed suit against MDY, the maker of Glider. Based on a claim of copyright infringement, WoWGlider became MMOGlider, but that was not enough. Recently, MMOGlider <a title="BBC Coverage" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7645059.stm" target="_blank">lost the lawsuit</a> filed by Blizzard. If you don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s big money involved, MDY has agreed to pay $6 million in damages!</p>

<p>From my observations, MMOGlider is still running strong. Tens of people are posting a day and still making money. I&rsquo;m interested to see how this plays out because of the implications to copyright infringement and what we&rsquo;re allowed to do in virtual worlds.</p>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/omg-did-you-ride-the-new-the-hills-bus-downtown-squeel/">OMG! Did you ride the new The Hills bus downtown? *SQUEEL*</a></h1>
      <p>Last night Andrea and I had a delightful meal at <a title="Cru" href="http://www.cruawinebar.com/" target="_blank">Cru</a>; we were enticed to try the restaurant as part of <a title="Austin Restaurant Week" href="http://www.restaurantweekaustin.com/" target="_blank">Austin Restaurant Week</a> where a number of pricey restaurants offer a special menu for less. Check it out if you&rsquo;re feeling fancy.</p>

<p>But I digress. The point of this post is to convince you of my brilliant scheme! So here we go&hellip;</p>

<p>Shortly after we sat down a nicely dressed (I mean rich-looking) young woman came in. Thirty minutes later, three more classy (I mean rich-looking) young women showed up. The newcomers apologized profusely for being late and said they were looking for parking.</p>

<p>I found it odd that more people don&rsquo;t ride buses downtown. It&rsquo;s cheap, convenient, and avoids the hassle of parking. However, something tells me that my dining mates would never ride the bus because it is too cheap. So why not make pricey public transportation?</p>

<p>People want status; some people want to show their status with pricey items. It&rsquo;s like <a title="Wikipedia Gentrification" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gentrification" target="_blank">gentrification</a> in our transport. The plan is simple:</p>

<ul>
<li>Set the price for riding so high that no riff raff can not afford the fare.</li>
<li>Make the buses luxurious.</li>
<li>Stop only at trendy locations.</li>
<li>Brand the buses with cosmopolitan (I mean vapid) shows like The Hills and Sex and the City.</li>
<li>Seed the first runs with celebrities.</li>
<li>Profit.</li>
</ul>


<p>With the fancy buses in place the rich-looking ladies&#8217; conversation about being late would change from &ldquo;Sorry, we were trying to find parking&rdquo; to &ldquo;Oh my God! We rode The Hills bus downtown! It was so <a title="Lauren Conrad the vapid heroine of The Hills" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lauren_Conrad" target="_blank">LC</a>!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Flawless! What do you think?</p>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/update-common-sense-fix-for-the-economy/">Update: Common Sense Fix for the Economy</a></h1>
      <p>Well, one <a title="SethHolloway.com: Common Sense Fix" href="http://sethholloway.com/blog/?p=210" target="_blank">common sense fix</a> for the economy was to drop capital gains taxes. Another one I found and really like is <a title="Wired.com Note to President" href="http://blog.wired.com/cars/2008/10/wall-street-bai.html" target="_blank">building infrastructure</a>.</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;A report card issued three years ago by the American Society of Civil Engineers <a href="http://www.asce.org/reportcard/2005/index2005.cfm">gives it all a D</a>. The society says we&rsquo;ve got to spend about $1.6 trillion just to bring things up to a B-.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>Comments after the article reveal a lot of fiscal conservatism which I normally agree with. However, in my opinion a government should provide defense and infrastructure. The US is behind on health care, education, and technology (broadband Internet and cell phone services to name a couple). In order to maintain our position of power/esteem (I know people worldwide hate USA so I&rsquo;m not sure what word to use, but you know what I mean), we must invest in infrastructure. America is too spread out to develop fully, but we can focus heavily on urban areas.</p>

<p>As a grad student I think we also need to increase research expenditures :)</p>

<p>This proposal is mired in long-standing debates and historical blunders, but I believe investing in infrastructure is a step in the right direction. I strongly believe that with the right systems in place, economic opportunities are infinite. Our odd blend of public and private systems is failing and needs serious reform.</p>

<p>The left-leaning L.A. Times mentions that the culprit, Mark Jacoby, leads a firm called Young Political Majors (YPM) which is known to bait and switch people into registering as GOP members. The lawyers are saying the arrest was &ldquo;political&rdquo; which I assume is a clever pun&hellip;</p>

      <p>Recently Marky Mark was mimicked as part of a ridiculous skit from my favorite current SNL cast member, Andy Sandberg. I missed the broadcast since <a title="SethHolloway.com: NBC vs Time Warner" href="http://sethholloway.com/blog/?p=148" target="_blank">I don&rsquo;t have NBC</a>, but I&rsquo;ve seen the skit online. (And honestly, I probably wouldn&rsquo;t have watched SNL even if I had NBC.) Check it out:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hey goat! I like your goatee! I had a goatee like that in A Perfect Storm. Did you ever see that movie?&hellip; Say &lsquo;hello&rsquo; to your mother for me!&rdquo;
Mark Wahlberg responded as anyone with a sense of humor should, by appearing on SNL to set the record straight. Check it out:</p>

<p>This episode of SNL was the highest rated in 14 years and featured Sarah Palin. She brought her folksy charm to America without adding any substance&mdash;she may be ready for politics after all.</p>

<p>Speaking of Mark Wahlberg; did anyone see Max Payne yet? It looks decent.</p>

      <p>I came across a &ldquo;<a title="Common Sense Fix" href="http://www.daveramsey.com/media/pdf/the_common_sense_fix.pdf" target="_blank">common sense fix</a>&rdquo; for the economy that I found interesting. In particular, I like the idea of removing capital gains taxes:</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;Remove the capital gains tax completely. Investors will flood the real estate and stock
market in search of tax-free profits, creating tremendous—and immediate—liquidity in
the markets. Again, this costs the taxpayer nothing.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure that anyone is staying out of the market for fear of paying 15% tax, but it would be simple to waive gains taxes for 2008.</p>

<p>Ramsey also thinks we should stop paying incentives for CEO failures. I agree. Sure enough, Wall Street has already taken the government&rsquo;s money and <a title="Executives are getting $$$" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2008/oct/17/executivesalaries-banking" target="_blank">paid itself hefty bonuses</a> :&lsquo;(</p>

      <p>Earlier this week I mentioned a couple ideas to <a title="Seth Holloway dot com" href="http://sethholloway.com/blog/?p=205" target="_blank">freshen voting</a>. Sean mentioned the <a title="wikipedia condorcet" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet_method" target="_blank">Condorcet method</a> which is really cool (thanks!). The meat of the idea is to rank each candidate in terms of preference then determine the winner with a neat algorithm. I like that &ldquo;&hellip; the Condorcet method yields the &#8220;best compromise&rdquo; candidate, the one that the largest majority will find to be least disagreeable&hellip;&#8221;</p>

<p>Imagine all the heads exploding when <a title="wikipedia john q public" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Q._Public" target="_blank">Joes Sixpack</a> had to try and maximize their personal interests. With three candidates on the ballot, Republicans and Democrats would cancel one another out and a third party would rise as the &lsquo;least disagreeable&rsquo; candidate.
