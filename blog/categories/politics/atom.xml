    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Food prices worldwide are rising. People are starving. People are protesting. With no end in sight, this issue seems incredibly important. A slew of journalists are discussing the complex issue involving food, fuel, natural disasters, politics, and more. Luckily, I have not been hit hard by rising food costs, but I know that others have been. A story on <a href="http://www.npr.org/" target="_blank">NPR</a>  inspired my post.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/15/business/worldbusiness/15food.html?ei=5065&amp;en=9e715f242c497f48&amp;ex=1208923200&amp;partner=MYWAY&amp;pagewanted=print" target="_blank">This article in the New York Times</a> discusses the link between biofuels and rising food prices worldwide. The article is full of facts and quotes, but it does not accurately consider the larger issues. For more insight, I cite <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-rice13-2008may13,0,3507989.story" target="_blank">this article in the L.A. Times</a>, which discusses the United States' role in Haitian food riots.</p>

<p>For years industrialized nations have been &ldquo;helping&rdquo; poor nations survive by providing food. Sadly, developing nations have (almost) by definition, agricultural economies meaning one of the few goods a developing nation can provide is food. Foreign aid artificially increases supply so that the working poor cannot hawk their wares.</p>

<p>There are numerous countries that survive on agriculture, so why don&rsquo;t they step up and make some money on the high demand and low supply?</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>According to <a title="Frank Levy" href="http://web.mit.edu/flevy/www/">Frank Levy</a>, <a title="Frank Levy's lecture at Swarthmore" href="http://web.mit.edu/flevy/www/Bernie%20Saffran%20Swarthmnore%20Lecture.pdf">the New World economy is not kind to anyone but the elite</a> (economics start on page 4). This does not bode well for the future.</p>

<p>Levy is doing very interesting research on the changing world market. I&rsquo;m particularly fond of neo-skilled labor. His research matches almost perfectly with several debates I&rsquo;ve had with other engineers&ndash;I wish I would have read the studies earlier so I could bring a different perspective.</p>

<p>I find it somewhat ironic that Dr. Levy is leading the charge into the changing global economy when he and his kin are extremely well educated (his wife is a professor at Harvard, his son is an MBA, and his daughter is a lawyer). Do the unwashed masses already know the simple truths that Dr. Levy espouses? Did academia just open the door into reality or is this truly new?</p>

    <id>http://sethholloway.com/a-better-way-to-distribute-aid-worldwide</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The United States provides <a title="US Census aid numbers" href="http://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/cats/foreign_commerce_aid/foreign_aid.html" target="_blank">billions of dollars of aid to foreign nations every year</a>. It is questionable whether or not the aid is truly helping the people and if recipients are grateful for the assistance. For example, <a title="Why U.S. Farm Subsidies Are Bad for the World" href="http://www.commondreams.org/views02/0506-09.htm">some say</a> that giving food to agricultural nations actually reduces their ability to make money and improve themselves.</p>

<p>Rather than debate the current structure, why don&rsquo;t we use that money to fund trips abroad? American teens could have a federally funded <a title="Wikipedia: Gap Year" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gap_year">gap year</a>. As these travelers spend, they generate new jobs and bring up the people in the nations they visit. They might also gain some perspective and change the attitude that we&rsquo;re Ugly Americans.</p>

<p>What do you think, best idea ever? :)</p>

<p>For a glimpse at one can happen when you distribute food to hungry people check out the <a title="Anthony Bourdain No Reservations 10m in" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6gmB-jYd-c#at=600">No Reservations Haiti episode (10 minutes in)</a>.</p>

    <id>http://sethholloway.com/one-visual-all-of-americas-energy</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As I&rsquo;ve said <a title="Seth Holloway: World Religion Visual" href="http://sethholloway.com/blog/2009/07/12/world-relgions-visual/" target="_blank">before</a>, I&rsquo;m a sucker for effective visualizations. In this age of &ldquo;<a title="Wikipedia: American Energy Independence" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_energy_independence" target="_blank">energy independence</a>&rdquo; I was really taken aback by this visual: the energy generation, transmission, and consumption in the U.S. Given the complexity of the information and sheer volume of data to present, I think this visual does an excellent job. (Other interesting visuals are available on the Lawrence Livermore site <a title="Energy at Lawrence Livermore" href="https://eed.llnl.gov/flow/" target="_blank">here</a>. Thanks to <a title="Drew Stovall" href="http://www.dstovall.com/" target="_blank">Drew</a> for sharing this with me.)</p>

<p><a href="https://eed.llnl.gov/flow/images/LLNL_Energy_Chart300.jpg"><img title="Energy Generation, Transmission, and Consumption" src="https://eed.llnl.gov/flow/images/LLNL_Energy_Chart300.jpg" alt="U.S. Energy Generation, Transmission, and Consumption" width="550" height="400" /></a></p>

<p>Notice how little energy alternative sources are producing. Also, notice that we&rsquo;re losing a ton of energy to transmission. In fact, if we could halve transmission losses we could eliminate all imports.</p>

<p>Does anything else stand out to you? More notable points than mine? Is the graphic missing data that you would like to see? Is energy independence truly achievable?</p>

    <updated>2008-11-14T00:00:00-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://sethholloway.com/obama-cto</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I came across a website that <a title="Obama CTO" href="http://obamacto.org/" target="_blank">tallies votes on technological ideas that the Obama CTO</a> will hopefully take to heart. I like the voting scheme employed; you&rsquo;re given 10 votes and you can give up to three votes per idea&ndash;kind of like the <a title="wikipedia Condorcet" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet_method" target="_blank">Condorcet voting method</a> <a title="seth holloway dot com comments" href="http://sethholloway.com/blog/?p=205" target="_blank">I learned about</a> during this presidential election.</p>

<p>I agreed with the top three choices (net neutrality, repeal the patriot act, and repeal the DMCA), so these received one vote each. I also put one point into restoring DARPA because I&rsquo;m a fan of futuristic research that may have no commercial impacts for years to come. I put three votes towards more research into energy and rethinking IP law because those are two of my biggest technological pet peeves.</p>

<p>The site has a lot of good ideas, although I would like to see more about security. All the money and technology in the world will be useless if we do not have control of our own machines. America has criminalized hacking rather than studying it; without knowledge of hacking, how can we stop it?</p>

<p>I would also like to see more push for improving technological infrastructure so that America can continue to compete in the future. We know the theory, but other nations are actually implementing these cool ideas.</p>

<p>In your opinion is the site missing any good ideas? Where did you put your 10 votes?</p>
