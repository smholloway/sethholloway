    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Food prices worldwide are rising. People are starving. People are protesting. With no end in sight, this issue seems incredibly important. A slew of journalists are discussing the complex issue involving food, fuel, natural disasters, politics, and more. Luckily, I have not been hit hard by rising food costs, but I know that others have been. A story on <a href="http://www.npr.org/" target="_blank">NPR</a>  inspired my post.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/15/business/worldbusiness/15food.html?ei=5065&amp;en=9e715f242c497f48&amp;ex=1208923200&amp;partner=MYWAY&amp;pagewanted=print" target="_blank">This article in the New York Times</a> discusses the link between biofuels and rising food prices worldwide. The article is full of facts and quotes, but it does not accurately consider the larger issues. For more insight, I cite <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-rice13-2008may13,0,3507989.story" target="_blank">this article in the L.A. Times</a>, which discusses the United States' role in Haitian food riots.</p>

<p>For years industrialized nations have been &ldquo;helping&rdquo; poor nations survive by providing food. Sadly, developing nations have (almost) by definition, agricultural economies meaning one of the few goods a developing nation can provide is food. Foreign aid artificially increases supply so that the working poor cannot hawk their wares.</p>

<p>There are numerous countries that survive on agriculture, so why don&rsquo;t they step up and make some money on the high demand and low supply?</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>According to <a title="Frank Levy" href="http://web.mit.edu/flevy/www/">Frank Levy</a>, <a title="Frank Levy's lecture at Swarthmore" href="http://web.mit.edu/flevy/www/Bernie%20Saffran%20Swarthmnore%20Lecture.pdf">the New World economy is not kind to anyone but the elite</a> (economics start on page 4). This does not bode well for the future.</p>

<p>Levy is doing very interesting research on the changing world market. I&rsquo;m particularly fond of neo-skilled labor. His research matches almost perfectly with several debates I&rsquo;ve had with other engineers&mdash;I wish I would have read the studies earlier so I could bring a different perspective.</p>

<p>I find it somewhat ironic that Dr. Levy is leading the charge into the changing global economy when he and his kin are extremely well educated (his wife is a professor at Harvard, his son is an MBA, and his daughter is a lawyer). Do the unwashed masses already know the simple truths that Dr. Levy espouses? Did academia just open the door into reality or is this truly new?</p>

    <id>http://www.sethholloway.com/sethholloway/a-better-way-to-distribute-aid-worldwide</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The United States provides <a title="US Census aid numbers" href="http://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/cats/foreign_commerce_aid/foreign_aid.html" target="_blank">billions of dollars of aid to foreign nations every year</a>. It is questionable whether or not the aid is truly helping the people and if recipients are grateful for the assistance. For example, <a title="Why U.S. Farm Subsidies Are Bad for the World" href="http://www.commondreams.org/views02/0506-09.htm">some say</a> that giving food to agricultural nations actually reduces their ability to make money and improve themselves.</p>

<p>Rather than debate the current structure, why don&rsquo;t we use that money to fund trips abroad? American teens could have a federally funded <a title="Wikipedia: Gap Year" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gap_year">gap year</a>. As these travelers spend, they generate new jobs and bring up the people in the nations they visit. They might also gain some perspective and change the attitude that we&rsquo;re Ugly Americans.</p>

<p>What do you think, best idea ever? :)</p>

<p>For a glimpse at one can happen when you distribute food to hungry people check out the <a title="Anthony Bourdain No Reservations 10m in" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6gmB-jYd-c#at=600">No Reservations Haiti episode (10 minutes in)</a>.</p>

<p>It seems elegant to me. Has he, or have I, missed something?</p>

<p>All politics aside, here&rsquo;s what we should try:</p>

    <id>http://www.sethholloway.com/sethholloway/one-visual-all-of-americas-energy</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As I&rsquo;ve said <a title="Seth Holloway: World Religion Visual" href="http://sethholloway.com/blog/2009/07/12/world-relgions-visual/" target="_blank">before</a>, I&rsquo;m a sucker for effective visualizations. In this age of &ldquo;<a title="Wikipedia: American Energy Independence" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_energy_independence" target="_blank">energy independence</a>&rdquo; I was really taken aback by this visual: the energy generation, transmission, and consumption in the U.S. Given the complexity of the information and sheer volume of data to present, I think this visual does an excellent job. (Other interesting visuals are available on the Lawrence Livermore site <a title="Energy at Lawrence Livermore" href="https://eed.llnl.gov/flow/" target="_blank">here</a>. Thanks to <a title="Drew Stovall" href="http://www.dstovall.com/" target="_blank">Drew</a> for sharing this with me.)</p>

<p><a href="https://eed.llnl.gov/flow/images/LLNL_Energy_Chart300.jpg"><img title="Energy Generation, Transmission, and Consumption" src="https://eed.llnl.gov/flow/images/LLNL_Energy_Chart300.jpg" alt="U.S. Energy Generation, Transmission, and Consumption" width="550" height="400" /></a></p>

<p>Notice how little energy alternative sources are producing. Also, notice that we&rsquo;re losing a ton of energy to transmission. In fact, if we could halve transmission losses we could eliminate all imports.</p>

<p>Does anything else stand out to you? More notable points than mine? Is the graphic missing data that you would like to see? Is energy independence truly achievable?</p>
