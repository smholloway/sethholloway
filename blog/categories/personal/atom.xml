    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Below are my favorite <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/10936110">reads from 2018</a>. In 2018 my reading focused a lot on improving myself in order to make me a better husband, father, manager, and all-around person.</p>

<p>Over the years I&rsquo;ve read a lot about management, however, a lot of it is very high level. I read and enjoyed <a href="https://www.radicalcandor.com/">Radical Candor</a> by Kim Scott because it provided an opinionated overview of how to manage like when and how to have career conversations. I found a lot of the suggestions helpful as I officially began my management career.</p>

<p>I finished the available <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Years_of_Lyndon_Johnson">LBJ biographies by Robert A. Caro</a>, which I highly recommend. Between those and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dictator%27s_Handbook">The Dictator&rsquo;s Handbook: Why Bad Behavior is Almost Always Good Politics</a> by Bruce Bueno de Mesquita I had a new framework for interpreting today&rsquo;s political landscape.</p>

<p>On the non-fiction front, I read and enjoyed the <a href="http://nnedi.com/books/binti.html">Binti</a> series and the <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/series/192752-bobiverse">Bobiverse</a> series. Both were quick, thought-provoking sci-fi series.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Free-form notes from a presentation by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B._J._Fogg">BJ Fogg</a> on <a href="http://www.behaviormodel.org/">behavior change</a>.</p>

<p>Behavior happens when you have <em>motivation</em>, <em>ability</em>, and a <em>prompt</em>.</p>

<h3>To stop a behavior:</h3>

<ul>
<li>reduce motivation</li>
<li>make it harder</li>
<li>remove prompt</li>
</ul>


<h3>To encourage a behavior:</h3>

<ul>
<li>make it easy</li>
<li>build onto existing routine</li>
<li>re-wire your brain (find a way to celebrate)</li>
</ul>


<p>This is a simple process but change is not easy. We should approach behavior change with compassion, playfulness, and iteration.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Below are my favorite reads from 2017.</p>

<h3>Fiction</h3>

<ul>
<li><a href="">Reamde</a> by Neal Stephenson &ndash; I have enjoyed every Neal Stephenson book I&rsquo;ve read, and this is no exception. I&rsquo;ve played a lot of online games over the years, so this book hooked me by starting off with a computer virus spread in an online game. It develops nicely from there.</li>
<li><a href="">The Moon is a Harsh Mistress</a> by Robert Heinlein &ndash; Truly ahead of its time. This book felt modern with its space travel and artificial intelligence, but it was written in the 1950s!</li>
<li><a href="">Ancillary Justice</a> by Leckie &ndash; This book has won a ton of awards so it is not too surprising that it is good. It has some really interesting ideas with AI and consciousness.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Series</h3>

<ul>
<li><a href="">Super Powereds</a> by Drew Hayes &ndash; College kids with super powers. That&rsquo;s a hell of a mashup. I found the three published books very entertaining. The characters were interesting, the scenarios were realistic, and the magic system was well thought out and balanced (which is not easy to do with super powers).</li>
</ul>


<h3>Non-fiction</h3>

<ul>
<li><a href="">The Path To Power</a> and <a href="">Means of Ascent</a> by Robert Caro &ndash; These are the first two books in a long biography series about LBJ, one of America&rsquo;s most interesting presidents. Ryan Holiday recommended these and I see why. Amazing character and great writing make these books easy to read. It helped me feel better about today&rsquo;s political climate.</li>
<li><a href="">Ideal Team Player</a> by Lencioni &ndash; Lencioni has carved out a niche with his leadership fables&mdash;basically, business books wrapped in a narrative. I&rsquo;ve read most of his books now and they fit together really nicely. I want to be an ideal team player and this book gave me food for thought.</li>
<li><a href="">Anatomy of Peace</a> by The Arbinger Institute &ndash; Another business book wrapped in a narrative. Peace is a great goal, so I was glad to learn more about how we can all overcome conflict and find peace.</li>
</ul>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Below are my favorite reads from 2016.</p>

<h3>Fiction</h3>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://amzn.to/1RX9aIm">Lord of All Things</a> by Andreas Eschbach &ndash; This book had a lot of new-to-me ideas and the sci-fi was integrated nicely into a story I enjoyed. One of the things that stands out is that tradeoffs exist with every choice.</li>
<li><a href="http://amzn.to/2ixJgRY">Seveneves</a> by Neal Stephenson &ndash; Amazing concepts that my mind keeps turning over. I love Neal Stephenson and this is yet another mind-expanding novel from him. This book really hit him as Elon Musk started speaking more publicly about getting off Earth.</li>
<li><a href="http://amzn.to/2in6xFW">Stories of Your Life and Others</a> by Ted Chiang &ndash; I don&rsquo;t tend to read many short stories, but I&rsquo;m glad I read this collection. About half the stories were really good and still have me thinking.</li>
</ul>


<h4>Series</h4>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://amzn.to/1YefYmk">Red Rising by Pierce Brown</a></li>
<li><a href="http://amzn.to/1UHiSBW">Riyria Chronicles by Michael J. Sullivan</a></li>
<li><a href="http://amzn.to/2iWcyur">Lightbringer series by Brent Weeks</a></li>
</ul>


<h3>Non-fiction</h3>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://amzn.to/294eAPo">Them: Adventures with Extremists</a> by Jon Ronson &ndash; A great story in the midst of a very extreme 2016.</li>
<li><a href="http://amzn.to/2hHFvrV">Surely You&rsquo;re Joking, Mr. Feynman!: Adventures of a Curious Character</a> by Richard Feynman &ndash; This is my new standard for an autobiography. Entertaining and interesting throughout, with great insights into this curious character. I particularly liked that he didn&rsquo;t want more money because it would allow him to afford mistress, which he knew would ruin his life.</li>
<li><a href="http://amzn.to/2iUcmre">Home Game: An Accidental Guide to Fatherhood</a> by Michael Lewis &ndash; I would recommend this to any new father. It&rsquo;s short and funny with Michael Lewis plainly saying so many things I had thought. I&rsquo;ve used his question &ldquo;what percentage of the parenting does each parent do?&rdquo; several times now. He says that fathers do much less than mothers but there&rsquo;s a lot of social stigma to admitting that, which made me feel better.</li>
<li><a href="http://amzn.to/2in8Et5">When Things Fall Apart: Heart Advice for Difficult Times</a> by Pema Chodron &ndash; This book dovetailed nicely with my efforts to control my emotions. I read no more than one chapter at a time because it&rsquo;s heavy, introspective stuff. I was thrilled that I read this beeok when I saw Derek Sivers mention Pema Chodron in his <a href="http://nownownow.com/about">about now pages post</a>.</li>
</ul>


<p>That&rsquo;s my not-so-short list of favorites from 2016. I hope 2017 will be filled with as many great stories.</p>
